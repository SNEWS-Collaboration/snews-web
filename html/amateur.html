    <p>SNEWS may be your chance to make a significant contribution to science! Be the first to pinpoint a
    rare Galactic supernova and make early observations!</p>

    <p>In the event of a supernova, neutrino detectors may yield limited information about where the
    supernova source is (in the best case, it may be a few degrees; in the worst case there could be no
    pointing information at all.). Therefore amateurs, with their wide viewing capabilities, may well be the
    first to find the supernova and point more powerful telescopes to the event. Very early data taken by
    amateurs themselves may be of prime importance, too. Because Galactic supernovae are so rare (a few per
    century), it will be especially crucial to see the very early turn-on of the light. The time between the
    neutrino burst warning and the first visible light could be minutes, hours or days, depending on the
    nature of the stellar envelope and the amount of obscuration.</p>

    <p><b>So time is of the essence!</b> If you receive a SNEWS alert, get out there and look!</p>

    <p><i><a href="http://skytonight.com/">Sky and Telescope</a></i> provides an <a href=
    "http://skytonight.com/resources/proamcollab/3304941.html">AstroAlert</a> service
    for notification of amateurs. It will also serve as a clearinghouse for amateur observations, so that
    information about the direction of a supernova can be disseminated as soon as possible to other
    observers, including professionals.</p>

    <p>You may also sign up to be notified directly by SNEWS: please look <a href="alert.html">here</a> for
    information on how to sign up. However, we recommend that amateur observers sign up for AstroAlert, and
    report observations via the <i>Sky and Telescope</i> feedback system (the <i>Sky and Telescope</i> folks
    are experts on observational astronomy; we are primarily neutrino physicists and won't know what to do
    with your material!). For more information, see <i>Sky and Telescope</i>'s articles by Leif J. Robinson:

    Neutrinos, and Amateur Astronomers", "<a href=

    Supernova Detector</a>", and "<a href=
