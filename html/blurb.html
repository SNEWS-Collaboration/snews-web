    <h1 class="PTitle">The SuperNova Early Warning System: Brief Description</h1>When a massive star
    collapses at the end of its life, most of its binding energy is emitted in the form of neutrinos. These
    neutrinos come in all flavors and emerge promptly from the stellar envelope, over a timescale of tens of
    seconds. If the star later explodes, the burst of supernova photons does not become visible until hours
    laters. Therefore the observation of a neutrino burst can provide a warning for astronomers that the
    opportunity for a rare and valuable observation of the early turn-on of supernova light may be soon be
    presenting itself. A number of neutrino experiments with sensitivity to a gravitational collapse event in
    our Galaxy are currently online, or will be in the future. The <a href="links.html">list</a> includes
    Super-Kamiokande, SNO, LVD, KamLAND, AMANDA, Borexino, mini-BOONE, and Icarus, as well as some proposed
    experiments such as OMNIS and LAND. In addition, gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo have
    sensivity to asymmetrically collapsing supernovae.

    <p>The basic idea of the early supernova alert project is to have a central computer (or computers) which
    accepts neutrino burst candidate messages from neutrino detectors around the world and sends an alarm
    message to astronomers if it finds a coincidence within a short period of time (10 seconds). Currently,
    there are two SNEWS coincidence computers, one at the Super-Kamiokande site in Mozumi, Japan, and one at
    Gran Sasso. Super-Kamiokande and LVD are are online in "automated mode"-- alert messages from each
    experiment are sent immediately. SNO, KamLAND, AMANDA are also involved at different levels. The
    coincidence is "blind", i.e. is done without polling other experiments if one message is received.</p>
