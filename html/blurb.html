    <h1 class="PTitle">The SuperNova Early Warning System: Brief
    Description</h1>When a massive star collapses at the end of its
    life, most of its binding energy is emitted in the form of
    neutrinos. These neutrinos come in all flavors and emerge promptly
    from the stellar envelope over a timescale of tens of seconds. If
    the star later explodes, the burst of supernova photons does not
    become visible until hours later. The observation of a
    neutrino burst can provide a warning for astronomers that the
    opportunity to get a rare glimpse at the collapse of a star,
	resulting in a supernova, may be soon be presenting itself. A
    number of neutrino experiments with sensitivity to a gravitational
    collapse event in our Galaxy are currently online, or will be in
    the future. In addition, gravitational wave detectors like
    LIGO and Virgo have sensivity to asymmetrically-collapsing
    supernovae.

    <p>The basic idea of the early supernova alert project is to have
    a central computer (or computers) which accepts neutrino burst
    candidate messages from neutrino detectors around the world and
    sends an alarm message to astronomers if it finds a coincidence
    within a short period of time (10 seconds). The central computer
    is located at Brookhaven National Lab.  The coincidence search is
    both "blind" (decision is made when messages are received without
    polling the other experiments) and automated (alerts go out
    without human intervention, for maximum speed.)  The neutrino
    experiments currently involved are Super-K, LVD, IceCube, Borexino, KamLAND, Daya Bay, and HALO.
