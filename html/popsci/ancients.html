<p><font size=+1>The Greek astronomer <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">Hipparchus</a>
  (c. 190 BCE--c. 120 BCE) was born in Nicaea, a city in what is now Turkey.
  In the year 135 BCE, he was stargazing and saw a bright point of light
  he didn't recognize. The constellation Scorpio had a new star which neither
  Hipparchus nor anyone he knew had ever seen before. Was it genuinely new,
  or had he just overlooked it before? To make sure he didn't miss anything
  else, he decided to map all the stars in the sky. Once he had a map showing
  all known stars, any unfamiliar one could simply be checked against the
  map, instantly telling whether or not it was a new object in the sky.</font>

<p><font size=+1>Hipparchus had a problem making his star chart. It was
easy enough to map the surface of the Earth, because the Earth has landmarks:
rivers, mountains, cities--places of known location, to which other places
can be compared. The sky, however, has no landmarks, just the stars themselves.
Hipparchus decided to invent "landmarks" of his own. He picked one point
in the sky and drew imaginary lines radiating out from it, like the spokes
of a wheel. Then he drew circles around this central point which grew larger
and larger. This made a grid around the sky, on which Hipparchus could
locate any star he wanted. This idea soon improved Earthly map-making as
well: the modern lines of longitude and latitude come directly from Hipparchus's
method of mapping the sky. Instead of locating stars on the "celestial
sphere" (the entire area visible around the Earth), later map-makers drew
gridlines on their charts of the Earth's sphere. Many modern globes show
these lines, one set (the <i>meridians</i>) radiating out from the North
Pole and the other going around the other way, parallel to the Equator.
Today, the sky's "North Pole" is near (but not exactly on) the star Polaris,
in the constellation Ursa Minor (the "Little Bear").</font>
<p><font size=+1>Hipparchus never confirmed whether the bright light he
saw was truly a new star. Because no one knew exactly what he had seen,
most Greek astronomers believed that nothing beyond the Earth changed.
According to <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristotle.html">Aristotle</a>
(384 BCE-322 BCE), one of the most famous Greek scientists, everything
in the regions outside the Earth was perfect and eternally unchanging.
All objects in the heavens were supposed to be perfect circles, except
for stars, which were featureless points of light.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This view had problems from the beginning. We all know
about the "Man in the Moon", a collection of bright and dark spots which
makes the Moon look like it has a picture on it. Different cultures describe
the shape differently (a woman with an umbrella, a rabbit, or a man's face)
but everyone can see something is there that's not a perfect, featureless
circle. While the Sun is too bright to view directly, at sunrise and sunset
it becomes larger and dimmer. Occasionally, at these times one can see
spots on its surface, dark regions against the orangish-red of the solar
disk. These "sunspots" can be seen more easily by shining the sun's light
through a telescope onto a piece of paper.</font>
<p><font size=+1>After the Roman Empire conquered the early scientific
center of Alexandra in Egypt, science in Europe and the Mediterranean regions
went into a decline. (We consider Alexandria to be part of Greek culture,
rather than Egyptian, because it was founded by the conqueror
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander
the Great</a> (356 BCE-323 BCE). Alexander conquered so many nations that
he spread Greek culture as far as northern India. The years following his
death are called the "Hellenistic age", <i>Hellenes</i> being the name
the Greeks gave themselves.) The last important Alexandrian scientist was
Hypatia (c. 370 CE-415 CE), who was murdered by a mob of fanatical monks.
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia">Some accounts</a> indicate
her flesh was scraped from her bones with oyster shells. ) For many centuries,
the Chinese and Japanese were the world's foremost astronomers. While in
Europe learning stagnated, first during the Roman Empire and then into
the "Dark Ages" which followed the Empire's collapse, Japanese and Chinese
astronomers recorded the events going on in the heavens.</font>

<p><font size=+1>Arab nations also played a significant role in preserving
scientific knowledge throughout these dark times. The caliph Al-Mansur
(712-715), the founder of Baghdad, initiated a drive to copy all the surviving
ancient Greek books and translate them into Arabic. This knowledge--the
sum total the ancient world understood of astronomy, biology, mathematics,
medicine and physics--remained unknown in Europe until mercenary knights
defeated the Arab provinces in Spain.</font>
<p><font size=+1>While Asian astronomers were making careful observations,
European astronomy had degenerated into primitive notions of astrology,
treating anything and everything in the sky as omens of disaster. For example,
in 1066 CE, a comet appeared and moved through the constellations. Europe
went into widespread panic. A Norman aristocrat, Guillaume le Batard, who
ruled lands in the north of France, used this fear to his advantage. He
made the comet into a propaganda weapon, saying it was an omen foretelling
the defeat of his enemy, King Harold of England. Guillaume conquered England
the year the comet appeared, his Norman army defeating Harold's Saxon one
at the bloody Battle of Hastings. Ever since, we have known Guillaume by
the Englishified version of his name, William. ("le Batard", referring
to William's illegitimate birth, has also been changed to the more dignified
"the Conqueror".)</font>
<p><font size=+1>In the year 1054 CE, sky-watchers in Asia reported a bright
light in the constellation Taurus. For several weeks, it shone brightly
enough to be visible during daylight. Almost incredibly, European records
show nearly no indication that such a dazzling event ever occured. We can
only speculate how the Europeans managed to be so amazingly unobservant.
Perhaps the old Aristotelian ideas, demanding that the sky be changeless,
had too much power, and the people who did notice the star forced themselves
to ignore it. Or maybe it was just too cloudy. (L. A. Marschall proposed
an interesting theory: for many years, the Christian churches in Rome and
in Constantinople had been vehemently arguing the finer points of theology.
The conflict came to a head in July 1054; just two weeks after the supernova
became visible, Pope Leo IX excommunicated the Patriarch of the Eastern
Orthodox Church. Since astronomical events were treated as omens of disaster,
Marschall argues, perhaps the summer of 1054 wasn't the best time to be
recording unusual new stars. Like many theories, this speculation is difficult
to disprove.) Anasazi observers, Native Americans living in what is now
Arizona and New Mexico, may also have noticed the 1054 supernova. A few
<a href="http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/outside/chaco/nebula.html">petroglyphs</a>
are all they left behind, but that is more substantial than the European
records. Chinese astronomers called this new light, and others like it,
"guest stars". These guest stars, <i>kohsing</i> in Mandarin, started invisible
and grew brighter, sometimes lasting months before fading away again.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We know the Chinese were not mistaken because we can see
the debris these stellar events left behind. Where they reported their
guest star, modern astronomers see the <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m001.html">Crab
Nebula</a>, a cloud of gas thrown out by an exploding star.</font>
