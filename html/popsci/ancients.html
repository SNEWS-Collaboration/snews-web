    <h3><b>Ancient Astronomy</b></h3>

    <p>The Greek astronomer <a href=
    "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">Hipparchus</a>
    (c. 190 BCE--c.  120 BCE) was born in Nicaea, a city in what is
    now Turkey. In the year 135 BCE, he was stargazing and saw a
    bright point of light he didn't recognize. The constellation
    Scorpio had a new star which neither Hipparchus nor anyone he knew
    had ever seen before. Was it genuinely new, or had he just
    overlooked it before? To make sure he didn't miss anything else,
    he decided to map all the stars in the sky. Once he had a map
    showing all known stars, any unfamiliar one could simply be
    checked against the map, instantly telling whether or not it was a
    new object in the sky.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Hipparchus had a problem making his star chart. It was easy
    enough to map the surface of the Earth, because the Earth has
    landmarks: rivers, mountains, cities--places of known location, to
    which other places can be compared. The sky, however, has no
    landmarks, just the stars themselves. Hipparchus decided to invent
    "landmarks" of his own. He picked one point in the sky and drew
    imaginary lines radiating out from it, like the spokes of a
    wheel. Then he drew circles around this central point which grew
    larger and larger. This made a grid around the sky, on which
    Hipparchus could locate any star he wanted. This idea soon
    improved Earthly map-making as well: the modern lines of longitude
    and latitude come directly from Hipparchus's method of mapping the
    sky. Instead of locating stars on the "celestial sphere" (the
    entire area visible around the Earth), later map-makers drew
    gridlines on their charts of the Earth's sphere.  Many modern
    globes show these lines, one set (the <i>meridians</i>) radiating
    out from the North Pole and the other going around the other way,
    parallel to the Equator. Today, the sky's "North Pole" is near
    (but not exactly on) the star Polaris, in the constellation Ursa
    Minor (the "Little Bear").</p>

    <p>Hipparchus never confirmed whether the bright light he saw was
    truly a new star. Because no one knew exactly what he had seen,
    most Greek astronomers believed that nothing beyond the Earth
    changed.  According to <a href=
    "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristotle.html">Aristotle</a>
    (384 BCE-322 BCE), one of the most famous Greek scientists,
    everything in the regions outside the Earth was perfect and
    eternally unchanging. All objects in the heavens were supposed to
    be perfect circles, except for stars, which were featureless
    points of light.</p>

    <p>This view had problems from the beginning. We all know about
    the "Man in the Moon", a collection of bright and dark spots which
    makes the Moon look like it has a picture on it. Different
    cultures describe the shape differently (a woman with an umbrella,
    a rabbit, or a man's face) but everyone can see something is there
    that's not a perfect, featureless circle. While the Sun is too
    bright to view directly, at sunrise and sunset it becomes larger
    and dimmer. Occasionally, at these times one can see spots on its
    surface, dark regions against the orangish-red of the solar
    disk. These "sunspots" can be seen more easily by shining the
    sun's light through a telescope onto a piece of paper.</p>

    <p>After the Roman Empire conquered the early scientific center of
    Alexandra in Egypt, science in Europe and the Mediterranean
    regions went into a decline. (We consider Alexandria to be part of
    Greek culture, rather than Egyptian, because it was founded by the
    conqueror <a href=
    "http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/alexander-the-great">Alexander
    the Great</a> (356 BCE-323 BCE). Alexander conquered so many
    nations that he spread Greek culture as far as northern India. The
    years following his death are called the "Hellenistic age",
    <i>Hellenes</i> being the name the Greeks gave themselves.) The
    last important Alexandrian scientist was Hypatia (c. 370 CE-415
    CE), who was murdered by a mob of fanatical monks. (<a
    href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/hypatia.html">Some
    accounts</a> indicate her flesh was scraped from her bones with
    oyster shells. ) For many centuries, the Chinese and Japanese were
    the world's foremost astronomers. While in Europe learning
    stagnated, first during the Roman Empire and then into the "Dark
    Ages" which followed the Empire's collapse, Japanese and Chinese
    astronomers recorded the events going on in the heavens.</p>

      bin Musa Al-Khwarizmi</a>, prominent Muslim astronomer; coined
      the father of algebra</p> </div>

    <p>Arab nations also played a significant role in preserving
    scientific knowledge throughout these dark times. The caliph
    Al-Mansur (712-715), the founder of Baghdad, initiated a drive to
    copy all the surviving ancient Greek books and translate them into
    Arabic. This knowledge--the sum total the ancient world understood
    of astronomy, biology, mathematics, medicine and physics--remained
    unknown in Europe until mercenary knights defeated the Arab
    provinces in Spain.</p>

    <p>While Asian astronomers were making careful observations,
    European astronomy had degenerated into primitive notions of
    astrology, treating anything and everything in the sky as omens of
    disaster. For example, in 1066 CE, a comet appeared and moved
    through the constellations. Europe went into widespread panic. A
    Norman aristocrat, Guillaume le Batard, who ruled lands in the
    north of France, used this fear to his advantage. He made the
    comet into a propaganda weapon, saying it was an omen foretelling
    the defeat of his enemy, King Harold of England. Guillaume
    conquered England the year the comet appeared, his Norman army
    defeating Harold's Saxon one at the bloody Battle of
    Hastings. Ever since, we have known Guillaume by the Englishified
    version of his name, William. ("le Batard", referring to William's
    illegitimate birth, has also been changed to the more dignified
    "the Conqueror".)</p>

    <p>In the year 1054 CE, sky-watchers in Asia reported a bright
    light in the constellation Taurus. For several weeks, it shone
    brightly enough to be visible during daylight. Almost incredibly,
    European records show nearly no indication that such a dazzling
    event ever occured. We can only speculate how the Europeans
    managed to be so amazingly unobservant. Perhaps the old
    Aristotelian ideas, demanding that the sky be changeless, had too
    much power, and the people who did notice the star forced
    themselves to ignore it. Or maybe it was just too
    cloudy. (L. A. Marschall proposed an interesting theory: for many
    years, the Christian churches in Rome and in Constantinople had
    been vehemently arguing the finer points of theology. The conflict
    came to a head in July 1054; just two weeks after the supernova
    became visible, Pope Leo IX excommunicated the Patriarch of the
    Eastern Orthodox Church. Since astronomical events were treated as
    omens of disaster, Marschall argues, perhaps the summer of 1054
    wasn't the best time to be recording unusual new stars. Like many
    theories, this speculation is difficult to disprove.) Anasazi
    observers, Native Americans living in what is now Arizona and New
    Mexico, may also have noticed the 1054 supernova. A few <a href=
    "https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1604.html">petroglyphs</a>
    are all they left behind, but that is more substantial than the
    European records. Chinese astronomers called this new light, and
    others like it, "guest stars". These guest stars, <i>kohsing</i>
    in Mandarin, started invisible and grew brighter, sometimes
    lasting months before fading away again.</p>

    <p>We know the Chinese were not mistaken because we can see the
    debris these stellar events left behind.  Where they reported
    their guest star, modern astronomers see the <a href=
    "https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1604.html">Crab Nebula</a>, a cloud
    of gas thrown out by an exploding star.</p>
