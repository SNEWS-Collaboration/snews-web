  <p><i>The sun is a mass of incandescent gas</i>

  <i>A gigantic nuclear furnace</i>
  <br />
  <i>Where hydrogen is built into helium</i>
  <br />
  <i>At a temperature of millions of degrees. . . .</i>

  <p><b>The Neutrino</b> is a subatomic particle famous for its
  ability to slip through matter without interacting. Neutrinos have
  none of the "handles" by which most other particles affect one
  another: no electric charge, almost zero mass. They are so elusive
  that a light-year of lead, nine and one-half trillion kilometres
  (six trillion miles) would only stop half of the neutrinos flying
  through it. The only hope for detecting them is to put a large
  quantity of matter in one place and hope the occasional neutrino
  will, by dumb luck, strike an atom somewhere and interact with
  it. Because so many other radiation sources are releasing energy
  throughout the Universe, any detector trying to spot neutrinos has
  to deal with backgroud noise. Picking the signal out of this noise
  can be a challenge. To make the problem easier, neutrino detectors
  are built underground, often within deep mineshafts. The rock around
  the detector blocks any radiation not powerful enough to penetrate
  beneath the Earth; because neutrinos are so "slippery", they can
  pass through the rock and reach the detector device.</p>

  <p>Neutrinos are valuable to astronomers precisely because they are
  so evasive. Since even large thicknesses of matter don't have much
  effect, neutrinos can flow right through things which distort or
  block other types of radiation. For example, our Sun is a ball of
  hot gases, 1,392,000 kilometres (870,000 miles) in diameter. Nuclear
  fusion reactions at the Sun's core heat these gases, producing vast
  quantities of energy. We would like to know the details of what's
  going on inside the Sun's core, but the gaseous layers in the way
  block our view. The gas atoms scatter light so well that a single
  photon, the basic particle of light, takes roughly fifty thousand
  years to reach the Sun's surface. Photons leave the core, hit nearby
  atoms, bounce off them, hit other atoms, and spend centuries doing
  more and more of the same, until they manage to leak out in the
  thinner regions near the surface. All that scattering and jostling
  obscures the details of the interior, just like a bright city
  skyline looks vague and indistinct when observed through a thick
  fog. Neutrinos avoid this problem, because they don't like to
  interact with the Sun's atoms. Once nuclear reactions in the core
  produce neutrinos, they can radiate away and rapidly escape the
  Sun. Neutrino detectors, then, can tell us what happens deep within
  the solar core, because they bring us information directly from the
  source. In the city analogy's terms, they zip through the fog and
  reveal the metropolis behind it.</p>

  <p>The neutrino entered physics as the brainchild of <a href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pauli.html">Wolfgang
  Pauli</a> (1900-1958). Pauli was trying to explain a puzzling
  feature of beta decay, a type of nuclear reaction that frequently
  occurs in unstable heavy elements. In beta decay, a neutron within
  the atomic nucleus breaks down and turns into a proton, releasing an
  electron which flies away from the atom. Measurements showed that
  the electron's energy varied: sometimes it barely crept out of the
  nucleus's pull, and sometimes it shot away at high speed. Physicists
  could explain the high-energy case fairly easily: the electron
  simply carried the maximum energy the reaction could produce. What
  about the lower-energy cases, Pauli wondered.</p>

  <p>A basic principle, the <b>Conservation of Energy,</b> says that
  energy cannot vanish from existence. It cases where that appears to
  happen, it is in fact being transformed into a less obvious
  form. (To a physicist, watching energy vanish from a situation is
  like how many people feel watching money disappear from their bank
  account.) For example, when you throw a broken computer out the
  window, the Earth's gravity gives it a certain amount of energy,
  which shows up as the computer's speed. The higher it begins, the
  more energy and hence speed it gains by the time it hits the
  sidewalk below. When it impacts the ground, though, where does all
  that energy go? Answer: the <i>kinetic</i> energy the falling
  computer had from its motion went into <i>thermal</i> energy (both
  computer and sidewalk are a little warmer than before) and
  <i>acoustic</i> energy (the crash makes a sound). Also, some goes
  into distorting the shape of the computer, which (among other
  things) puts <i>potential</i> energy into bending pieces of metal
  and plastic.</p>

  <p>What kind of phenomenon could carry away the energy the electron
  didn't use? Pauli dreamt up a new particle, an entity which would
  pick up the slack, so to speak. It would have to be hard to detect,
  elusive enough to explain why no one had seen it before. Pauli
  decided the particle would have no electric charge, and that it
  would be very light, either totally massless or almost so. <a
  href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1938/fermi-bio.html">Enrico
  Fermi</a> (1901-1954) named this particle the
  <i>neutrino</i>, from an Italian word meaning "little neutral one".</p>

  <p>A later discovery, flavor change, complicates this issue
  somewhat. From the mid-1960s, when the solar neutrino flux was first
  measured, up until about 2002, the "solar neutrino problem" caused
  much debate. All detectors confirmed a puzzling result: the Sun was
  only emitting one-third to one-half of the neutrinos we
  expected. Large amounts of cleverness have gone into solving this
  problem, and developments in the past few years have been very
  exciting.</p> <hr />
