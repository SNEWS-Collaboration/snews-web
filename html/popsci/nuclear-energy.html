    Sun (September 2000)</p>
  </div>

  <p>A typical supernova can glow as brightly as an entire galaxy of a hundred billion stars, pouring out as
  much energy as our Sun will in its entire lifetime in a few months. To understand where this fantastic
  amount of energy comes from, it helps to understand where stars derive their normal energy supply, during
  the many millions of years their lives can last. Before the year 1896, scientists did not even have a
  candidate for the Sun's energy source, for the simple reason that no phenomenon then known could provide
  that much energy for that long. Were the Sun composed entirely of a chemical fuel like coal, for
  example--and if it also had the oxygen necessary to burn the coal, of course--it would go dark in a few
  thousand years. Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) proposed the idea that the Sun was contracting under its
  own gravitational pull, heating up as its own weight pulled its gases into a tighter and tighter ball. When
  he calculated how long <i>this</i> process would last, he discovered that the Sun could only have begun
  glowing at its present intensity some 70,000 years ago. This was worrisome, and not just because it implied
  that the Sun would die out comparatively soon, too: geologists studying the Earth's past had already
  decided that the planet was <i>at least</i> tens of millions of years old. Fossils of extinct animals like
  dinosaurs, already known to be millions of years old, clearly showed that the Earth was habitable at that
  time period, with the Sun performing then much as it does today. What could possibly power the Sun for
  those countless epochs, possibly upwards of a billion years?</p>

  <h3>Radioactivity</h3>

  </div>

  <p>In 1896, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered that a mineral containing the element
  <i>uranium</i> released energy, at a steady rate, for prolonged periods of time. A crystal of uranium
  mineral could fog a photographic plate, even if the plate were wrapped in dark cloth to block all visible
  light. In the following years, other elements were discovered which had the same effect, some even more
  strongly than uranium itself. The Polish physicist and chemist Marie Slodowska Curie (1867-1934) coined the
  term <i>radioactivity</i> to describe these elements' peculiar property. Working with a uranium ore known
  as pitchblende (mined, it happens, in the mountains of Bohemia), Marie and her husband Pierre Curie
  discovered that the ore was more radioactive than the uranium within it could account for. They deduced the
  presence of additional radioactive elements, more intensely radioactive than uranium. In July 1898, they
  isolated one of these elements, which they named <i>polonium</i>; in December of the same year, they
  isolated a still more radioactive element named <i>radium</i>. This work won them the 1903 Nobel Prize (the
  third ever given) in Physics, which they shared with Becquerel. For her work on polonium and radium, Marie
  won a second Nobel, this time in Chemistry, in 1911. (Her husband, Pierre, had by that time sadly been
  killed in a traffic accident.)</p>

  <p>The radioactivity of these minerals was the first indication that an energy source existed which was
  more powerful than chemical reactions. Radium, for example, glows in the dark, with practically
  undiminished intensity, for much longer than a human lifetime. Pierre Curie measured radium's rate of heat
  release to be 590 joules (140 calories) per hour for every gram of radium, enough to warm 1 cc of water 2.3
  degrees Celsius every minute. What's more, radium maintains this heat rate not just for hours or days, but
  <i>centuries</i>: after 1600 years, the heat-emission rate is still half of its original value.</p>

  <p>When this discovery became known, it rapidly found an application in industry. The hands of watches, and
  the numbers on their dials, were soon painted with radium compounds, which glowed a greenish color bright
  enough to be read at night. Sadly, the same radioactivity which produced this useful illumination--and
  which fogged photographic plates, as Becquerel had shown--also produced deleterious effects upon the human
  body. At the same time the Curies were working, the Dutch botanist Hugo Marie De Vries (1848-1935)
  described the phenomenon of <i>mutations</i>: he observed that the offspring of American evening primrose
  flowers (which had been introduced into the Netherlands in the 1880s) were sometimes noticeably different
  from the parent plants that had produced the seeds. De Vries observed traits in the flowers which appeared
  suddenly in one generation without having been visible in earlier ones, and he concluded that random
  factors must be producing changes in the flowers' genetic material. By 1927, the American biologist Hermann
  Muller (1890-1967) had shown conclusively that radiation, including X-rays and the emissions produced by
  radioactive minerals, sharply increased the rate of mutations. Most mutations, scientists discovered, were
  harmful to the organism they affected, frequently robbing the organism of the ability to conduct some
  necessary chemical function. Frequently, mutations are <i>carcinogenic</i>; that is, the genetic changes
  they involve lead to the uncontrolled cellular growth we call cancer. Muller, having discovered this
  harmful consequence of radiation, publicized his knowledge widely and fought for strong precautions on the
  handling of radiation--but his efforts were too late for the workers who had already developed serious
  health problems licking the brushes they'd used to paint radium onto watch dials.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Now, even when Pierre Curie made his measurements in 1901, it was fairly clear that neither the Sun nor
  any other visible star obtained its energy from radium. (For one thing, the Sun doesn't glow green like a
  painted watch dial!) However, it was still evident that somewhere within the atoms of these elements there
  lurked a potent energy source, one which could pour out heat and light for centuries without noticeable
  diminishment. The study of radioactivity led to many astonishing breakthroughs in our understanding of the
  atom; in terms of pure knowledge, it is certainly one of the most significant discoveries of the last
  several centuries. (The fact that the last sixty years have seen us use this knowledge to develop weapons
  capable of annihilating our own species and much besides may make the discovery of radioactivity more
  significant still.)</p>

  <h3>Atomic Structure</h3>

  <div class="figure_left" style="width: 200px">
    <img src="alpha-particle.jpg" width="200" alt="Alpha Particle Drawing" />

    <p>Helium-4 nucleus, with two protons (arbitrarily colored red to denote positive charge) and two
    neutrons.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The picture of the atom we have today, developed largely thanks to intensive study of radioactivity, is
  as follows. The center of each atom is a lump of material, known as the <i>atomic nucleus</i>, which
  contains almost all of the atom's mass and carries a positive electric charge. By the 1930s, it was known
  that the nucleus is composed of <i>protons</i>, which are positively charged and give the nucleus its
  overall electric properties, and <i>neutrons</i>, which are electrically neutral and therefore do not
  "feel" the effects of electric fields. (This made neutrons difficult to detect.) The outer regions of each
  atom--in fact the vast majority of the atom's volume-- are occupied by <i>electrons</i>, particles much
  lighter than either protons or neutrons, which carry a negative electric charge. In the normal state of
  affairs, the number of electrons in the outer regions equals the number of protons in the nucleus; since
  the size of the charge each particle carries is equal, the overall charge of the atom balances out to
  zero.</p>

  <p>It is frequently said that electrons "orbit" the nucleus, in much the same way that planets orbit the
  central star of their star system. This is a useful image for studying certain aspects of atomic behavior,
  but it is by no means a complete picture. By the late 1910s, for example, it was deduced that electrons
  could only "orbit" the nucleus at certain fixed distances, whereas (in principle) a planet could orbit the
  Sun in a circle of any radius. By 1928, it was well established that objects as small as protons, neutrons
  and electrons--in fact, anything on the sub-atomic scale--behave in a fundamentally different way than the
  entities with which we are familiar, which are made of many trillions of atoms. (A liter of something as
  insubstantial as ordinary air, for example, contains roughly 2.68x10<sup>22</sup> or
  26,800,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules, most of which are the two-atom nitrogen molecule N<sub>2</sub>.)
  Thanks principally to Erwin Schroedinger (1887-1961) and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), we have a
  mathematical way of describing this kind of subatomic behavior, a system called <i>quantum mechanics</i>.
  Countless experiments have shown that the world really <i>is</i> quantum-mechanical, when observed closely
  enough, but that doesn't make quantum behavior any more intuitive. (The physicist Richard Feynman
  (1918-1988) was fond of observing that, though the newspapers once claimed "only twelve men understand
  Einstein's Theory of Relativity", it wasn't really true: once people read Einstein's work, they probably
  understood it to some degree. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, <i>nobody</i> understands, even though
  scientists are able to use it to make calculations.)</p>

  </div>

  <p>Schroedinger's prescription for doing quantum mechanics, which lets us compute numerical answers for
  questions we pose, involves a quantity we call the "wave function". Essentially, if we want to know where
  in an atom we might find an electron, we imagine a sort of "cloud" which is denser in some regions than in
  others. This "cloud"--the wave function--tells us that we are most likely to observe the electron in the
  regions where the cloud is thickest. Before we actually make an observation, we can only know the
  <i>probability</i> that the electron is in one place or another. The shape of the wave function is
  influenced by electric fields or other forces; the familiar notion that like charges repel and opposite
  charges attract becomes, in quantum mechanics, a formula for the shape of the wave function, which we call
  <i>Schroedinger's Equation</i>.</p>

    <img src="atom1.jpg" width="250" alt="Hydrogen in quantum mechanics" />

    <p>How quantum mechanics sees a hydrogen atom: one electron "inhabiting" the space around one proton.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Schroedinger was able to calculate the different ways electrons can "inhabit" the space around an atom.
  With quantum-mechanical calculations as a background, it is possible to show that ordinary chemical
  reactions (combustion, rusting, or even the biochemical interactions inside living organisms) result from
  interactions among the electrons in the outer reaches of atoms. Atoms may "share" electrons, for example,
  forming a bond between them. Alternatively, one or more electrons may be removed entirely from one atom and
  donated to another. The donor atom, stripped of its electrons, has a net positive charge, while the
  recipient gains a net negative charge. Because opposite charges attract, these atoms can be bound together
  quite tightly. Large numbers of atoms, held together in such a fashion, can form structures difficult to
  disrupt. Ordinary table salt is an example: it is a crystal made of negative chloride ions (chlorine atoms
  with one extra electron) and positive sodium ions (which have lost one electron). The "electrostatic" force
  holding these ions together makes table salt ("sodium chloride") a crystal which is difficult to melt.</p>

  <p>The bonds formed by these electron interactions are, however, relatively weak. The shared-electron bonds
  which hold together the hydrogen and oxygen in water (H<sub>2</sub>O), for example, can be broken by an
  electric current supplied by a small battery. Put another way, it doesn't take much energy to disrupt a
  shared-electron bond. (Bonds produced by the <i>transfer</i> of electrons from atom to atom, such as those
  in salt crystals, are stronger, but can still be broken by electricity or chemical reactions.)</p>

  </div>

  <p>There is not much energy involved in rearrangeing the pattern of electrons around the nucleus,
  particularly when compared to the amount involved with altering the <i>nuclear</i> structure itself. To
  grasp the difference, note that ordinary chemical explosives like dynamite or TNT involve breaking
  shared-electron bonds to release energy. Nuclear weapons work by rearranging the protons and neutrons
  <i>inside</i> the nucleus (more details will follow, but this is the key notion). How much is the
  difference? Well, the <i>first time</i> we tried to blow something up using a nuclear "device", a few
  kilograms of material produced a blast equivalent to fifteen thousand <i>tons</i> of TNT. We have become
  more clever since then; technological advances have led to what Feynman (himself a group leader at Los
  Alamos) liked to call a "worse bomb".</p>

  <h3>Fission and Fusion</h3>

  <p>There are two primary ways nuclear reactions can produce energy. The first, which is familiar to us from
  Earthly radioactivity, involves large atomic nuclei splitting apart. The second, in which small nuclei are
  put together, is the mechanism which powers the stars. We call the joining of small nuclei into larger ones
  <i>fusion</i>, and we use the term <i>fission</i> to cover cases where large nuclei split into pieces.</p>

  <p>Of the two processes, fusion produces most of the energy we see in the Universe, and is also responsible
  for the variety of chemical elements we find in the world around us. However, fission was the first nuclear
  process human beings learned how to control.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed something odd about the picture of the atom described earlier: if like charges
  repel each other, and opposite charges attract, what keeps the protons in the nucleus--who all have the
  same charge--from flying apart? This is a real difficulty, and it puzzled scientists for many years. At
  first, they believed that the nucleus contained a few electrons, whose negative charge helped neutralize
  the protons' positive charge, making a kind of "cement" that held the nucleus together. Eventually, though,
  further experiments showed that the nucleus contained neutrons instead; because the neutron carries no
  electric charge, it cannot hold the nucleus together by electrical forces.</p>

  <p>This still leaves the possibility that some <i>other</i> force exists, some force which operates between
  protons and neutrons and makes them attract each other. Because this force must be strong enough to
  overcome the protons' electrical repulsion, scientists termed it the <i>strong nuclear force</i>. (There is
  also a weak nuclear force, which behaves in a different way, but we needn't worry about it just yet.) We
  now have a fairly good understanding of the way the strong force operates, though <i>why</i> such a force
  exists in the first place is still an unanswered question.</p>

  <p>The strong force can hold a small nucleus together very tightly. For example, the helium-4 nucleus,
  consisting of two protons and two neutrons, is a very stable unit. Larger nuclei, however, can be too big
  for the strong force to hold together. Sometimes, a large nucleus may "shed" small pieces. Because it is
  the number of protons in the atom which indicates what element the atom is, a nucleus emitting particles in
  this fashion changes the atom's chemical identity. Often, a heavy nucleus will emit a unit of two protons
  and two neutrons, all bound together, which is identical to the nucleus found in helium-4 (the most common
  variety of helium). This group is often called an alpha particle, a name invented before the particle's
  nature was known. (Early investigations of radioactivity led to the discovery of several kinds of
  radiation, which scientists named after the first letters in the Greek alphabet. This is kind of a running
  pattern: we find scientists talking about alpha and beta subunits in proteins, alpha and beta carbon atoms
  in molecules, and so on. As it turned out, beta rays are speeding electrons, released from the nucleus
  itself, and gamma rays are photons, or particles of light--but light of an extremely short wavelength, on
  the scale of the atomic nucleus itself.)</p>

  <div class="figure_right" style="width: 250px">
    <img src="uranium.jpg" width="250" alt="Uranium Nucleus" />

    <p>Nucleus of U-235: protons in red, neutrons in grey.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Sometimes, instead of merely emitting smaller particles, a heavy nucleus will react in a more radical
  way. If we take an atom of uranium-238, for example, and "whack" it with a neutron, the neutron may impact
  the U-238 nucleus, pushing it into an "excited" state, which then splits apart, releasing extra neutrons
  and extra energy. The extra neutrons released in this reaction are not themselves energetic enough to cause
  other U-238 atoms to fission. However, natural uranium consists of a mixture of isotopes, including one
  with three fewer neutrons per nucleus known as U-235. If we strike a U-<i>235</i> nucleus with a neutron,
  it may also fission, but unlike U-238, nuclei of U-235 <i>can</i> be broken apart by the neutrons fission
  releases. Therefore, if the U-235 atoms are packed together tightly enough, so that too many neutrons do
  not escape to the outside, we may witness a <i>chain reaction,</i> in which one fission event causes
  several more, which in turn cause many more, building up to a fantastic release of energy.</p>

  <p>Uranium is not the only "fissile" element. Plutonium, discovered in nuclear-reactor products in 1940,
  also works quite well. (The elements uranium, neptunium and plutonium were named after the planets Uranus,
  Neptune and Pluto, which were in turn named after <a href="http://www.theoi.com">ancient Greco-Roman
  gods</a>.) Many elements, even if they aren't actually suitable for chain reactions (and therefore nuclear
  fission bombs), break up into smaller pieces. Generally speaking, the more unstable an isotope, the less
  likely one will find it occuring naturally "in the wild". This is why, for example, technetium (element
  number 43) is so rare that it was produced in a lab before it was ever seen in nature: no isotope of
  technetium is stable enough to have survived the 4.5 billion years since the Earth formed. It can be
  extracted, however, from used nuclear fuel rods. (See this, fairly comprehensive <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium">article</a> and the references therein.)</p>

  <p>How did human beings first manufacture technetium? The answer will lead us to the second type of nuclear
  reaction, since it involves the putting-together of smaller nuclei. In 1937, Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre
  (1905-1989) bombarded molybdenum atoms (element number 42) with deuterium nuclei--that is, with "heavy
  hydrogen" nuclei having one proton <i>and</i> one neutron apiece. When a "deuteron" approaches a molybdenum
  nucleus, the positive charge of the molybdenum nucleus makes the deuteron split apart. The proton gets
  pushed away, but the uncharged neutron feels no electric repulsion, so it impacts the Mo nucleus and causes
  a reaction. (Why not bombard with neutrons in the first place? The positive charge of the deuteron provides
  a convenient "handle" for accelerating the particles, which is much more difficult to arrange with
  uncharged neutrons.) The neutron impact causes a nuclear reaction, which produced two different technetium
  isotopes, Tc-95 and Tc-97.</p>

  <p>By 1929, <a href="spectroscope.html">spectral analysis</a> had shown that the Sun is composed mostly of
  hydrogen and helium, in a 3:1 ratio by mass. In that year, the physicist George Gamow (1904-1968) suggested
  that, in the intense pressures and temperatures within the Sun's core, four hydrogen nuclei could fuse
  together to make one helium nucleus. The excess energy of this reaction would be, ultimately, what makes
  the Sun shine. In later years, Gamow's ideas were refined, particularly by Carl Weizsacker (b. 1912) and
  <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1967/bethe-bio.html">Hans Bethe</a> (1906-2005). It is
  this theory of nuclear fusion which answered Helmholtz's original question, providing a mechanism which
  could power the Sun's radiation for literally billions of years.</p>
