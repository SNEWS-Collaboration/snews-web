    <p>"The Serpent Bearer"</p>
  </div>

  <p>As an interesting side note, we should mention something
  remarkable about Ophiuchus. This constellation, also known as the
  "serpent bearer" (<i>pede Serpentarii</i> in Latin), lies fairly
  close to the ecliptic, the path through the sky along which the Sun
  moves. (How can we tell where the Sun is if we can't see the stars
  while it shines? Well, we can study the stars each night and note
  which ones are overhead at midnight. On the other side of the
  planet, the Sun is directly overhead, so our star chart will tell us
  where among the stars it is. By doing this process throughout the
  year, ancient astronomers were able to see that the Sun moves
  through the constellations, coming back to where it started every
  year, in a little more time than it took the Moon to go through all
  its phases twelve times. Our word "month" comes from "Moon"; this is
  why we have twelve months in a year, and the different lengths they
  have happens because the year is a little longer than twelve
  Moon-cycles.) The ancient Babylonians, who lived in the land which
  is now Iraq, were among the most sophisticated astronomers and
  mathematicians in the ancient world. The Greeks picked up many ideas
  from the Babylonians, nifty inventions like the sundial, plus
  theoretical ideas about the Sun and planets. One Babylonian idea the
  Greeks took for themselves was a plan for dividing the sky, roughly
  based upon the constellations they saw in it. The Babylonian
  astronomers divided the celestial sphere into twelve "houses",
  something like slicing an orange into wedges. They named each
  "house" based upon a prominent constellation they saw near the
  ecliptic in that house, so each section got a name.</p>

  <p>The Greeks named their constellations after characters in their
  myths and legends. When they learned about the Babylonian system for
  dividing up the sky, they called it "the circle of little animals",
  because most of the constellations they saw running around the
  ecliptic looked like animals. They had Scorpio, the scorpion;
  Pisces, the fish, and so on. In Greek, "circle of little animals"
  was <i>zodiakos kyklos</i>.  (You can see the same Greek root words
  in "zoology", the study of animals, "cycle" for something going in a
  circle, and "bicycle" for a machine with two circular wheels.) From
  <i>zodiakos kyklos</i> we get our word "zodiac". The Greeks split
  the year into twelve "signs", each one named for the part of the
  "animal circle" the Sun was located within during that part of the
  year. This is the basis of <i>astrology</i> and all the horoscopes
  we find in our newspapers, even today.</p>

    <p>The most laughable of pseudosciences?</p>
  </div>

  <p>Astrology has many problems, and is probably the most laughable of all the pseudosciences that try to
  sound scientific without having any real basis. Most people born on the same day don't turn out the same
  way. Thinking that one-twelfth of the entire world's population is having the same kind of day, every day
  of their lives, is more than humorous. Given the same date and place of birth, two different astrologers
  always cast two entirely different horoscopes, unless the horoscopes are so vague they can't be told apart
  (a useful trick: if the description is vague enough, it can apply to anybody). No one has found legitimate
  forces which can reach from the planets and affect people in anything like the way astrologers say. For
  example, the gravitational force of the doctor delivering a baby is roughly a million times stronger than
  the planet Jupiter's gravitational pull on that same child. The astronomer and writer Carl Sagan once
  observed that astrology is a doctrine akin to racism and sexism, since it ignores the differences among
  human beings.</p>

  <p>The pseudoscience of astrology has made many people in the modern world relatively wealthy. In past
  years, too, it was a means for astronomers to support themselves: Johannes Kepler might never have
  discovered his Laws of planetary motion, if the aristocrats of Europe hadn't been willing to pay for
  horoscopes. There exists an intriguing possibility, which a clever person might exploit, for a new and
  modern astrology system. The first person to build a business inventing horoscopes with this new system may
  be lucky enough to drive other astrologers out of work, since in the modern world, innovation is so often
  the key to success. This opportunity arises for the following reason:</p>

  <p>During some part of the year, the Sun is in Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
  Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius. It also passes through Ophiuchus. If you were born between
  November 30 and December 17, you are in fact an Ophiuchid, and you can be proud of it.&nbsp; 
  
  <p>Why did the Greeks overlook an entire constellation?  It's a pretty
  big act of denial.  We might look to the Babylonians for an
  explanation; they were the first to devise the twelve-sign system.
  The Babylonians enjoyed numbers like 12, 60 and 360, because each can
  be divided up evenly in many ways.  This is useful when you deal with
  many different fractions and you don't have a handy calculator.
  Because they were so much easier to work with, the Babylonians used these
  numbers whenver they could.  We have other artifacts of their
  preferences:  we still use 60 seconds in every minute and 60 minutes
  in every hour.  We divide circles into 360 degrees (unless you're a
  mathematician, in which case each circle has 6.28 and a bit 
  <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radian.html">radians</a>).
  Perhaps this is the origin of <i>triskadekaphobia,</i> the fear of the
  number 13.  Ever been in an office building and seen the elevator go
  straight from floor 12 to floor 14?  It makes no sense, and it just
  might come from the Babylonian preference for 12 over any other number
  near it.  When you're used to seeing 12 as "good", 13 might start
  feeling, well, unlucky.  No wonder they scratched a constellation off
  their list and made the zodiac have one fewer than it should.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_Cowgirls_Get_the_Blues_(novel)">Tom Robbins's</a> 1976 novel <i>Even Cowgirls Get
  the Blues</i> contains a reference to the missing thirteenth zodiacal constellation.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>What is the numerical significance of the Clock People's taking thirteen months to structure their
    ritual, then separating into thirteen families? Well, briefly, they consider thirteen a more natural
    number than twelve. To the ancient Babylonians, thirteen was unlucky. That is why, when they invented
    astrology, they willfully overlooked a major constellation, erroneously assigning to the zodiac only
    twelve constellations. The Clock People knew nothing of Babylonian superstition, but they knew the stars,
    and it was partly in an effort to override the unnatural twelve-mindedness of Western culture that they
    chose to give thirteen its due</i> (p. 188).</p>
