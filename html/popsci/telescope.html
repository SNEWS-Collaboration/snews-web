<p><font size=+1>Kepler saw his supernova in the year 1604. Four years later,
  an eyeglass-maker living in Holland, Hans Lippershey (1570-1619), put two
  lenses on the ends of a tube, making a device which made distant objects
  look larger. In 1609, Galileo Galilei built his own, improved telescope,
  which he offered to the city leaders of Venice, saying it could be used
  to spot ships at sea. The Venetians, pleased that they could see incoming
  merchant vessels two hours ahead of their competition (and therefore get
  a jump on the market) gave Galileo a considerable pay raise. By the end
  of that year, however, Galileo had shifted his attention to grander sights,
  aiming his instrument at the sky. He published his observations in the
  short book <i>Siderius Nuncius</i>, Latin for <i>The Starry Messenger</i>.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>Galileo's book blasted the old view of the Universe apart.
He described spots of light he had seen moving around the planet Jupiter.
The telescope made it clear that they were Jupiter's moons, circling the
planet the way Earth orbits the Sun and our Moon orbits the Earth. Furthermore,
his telescope revealed that Venus goes through phases just like the Moon
does, sometimes showing a thin crescent and at other times a complete disk.
Galileo concluded that he was seeing the planet illuminated differently
as it traveled around the Sun, one more piece of evidence that Copernicus
had been right and Aristotle wrong.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Few people can have the opportunity Galileo had. Anywhere
he pointed his telescope, he made a new discovery. To balance this luck,
perhaps, Galileo's support of Copernicus landed him in trouble with the
Inquisition, and the Catholic Church eventually placed him under house
arrest. Even more galling, though, is the thought of the discovery he missed,
by just a few short years. Had Galileo owned his telescope six years before,
he could have observed Kepler's supernova, the bright star of 1604. He
might not have spotted it sooner (with a telescope, small areas of the
sky look big, so picking the right place to look can be a challenge), but
he could have observed it long after it was too dim for the naked eye to
see.&nbsp;</font><!-- <p>Supernovas in other galaxies
