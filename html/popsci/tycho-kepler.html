  <h3>Tycho and Kepler</h3>

  <p>Despite these problems, the Greek astronomers and most of the
  people who listened to them believed that celestial objects were
  perfect circles, moving in perfect circles without change for all
  time. This view fell apart thanks to the Danish astronomer <a href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Brahe.html">Tycho
  Brahe</a> (1546-1601). Tycho, usually called by his first name, led
  an unusual life in many respects. He was born into the upper crust
  of Danish nobility. Attending a dance at a professor's house at the
  University of Rostack, Germany, he fell into an argument with
  another aristocrat, Manderup Parsbjerg. They fought, and Tycho lost
  his nose. For the rest of his life, he wore a metal replacement,
  usually said to be made from silver. According to legend, he died
  when good manners forced him to remain at a banquet table, even
  though he desperately needed to urinate. After several hours of this
  torture, his bladder burst.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/24835-astronomer-tycho-brahe-death.html">
  Investigations</a> proved that it was indeed a pee related death,
  and not one of mercury poisoning, which was rumored to have been the
  case after mercury was claimed to have been found in the remains of Brahe
  when his grave was examined on the 300th anniversary of his death. New,
  more detailed analysis though shows that it was indeed a ruptured bladder
  that led to the demise of on of the greatest minds of the 16th century.

  <p>Almost thirty years before his unusual demise, Tycho had shocked
  Europe. In November of 1572, he was walking home from his uncle's
  chemistry laboratory and noticed a new star, shining brightly in the
  constellation Casseopeia. We now know that this was a supernova, a
  massive star that reached the end of its fuel supply and
  exploded. Aristotle's astronomy said that nothing in the heavens
  really changed; all events that looked otherwise (comets, falling
  stars and such) were really just like clouds or storms, weather
  happening in the Earth's air. Tycho showed that his new star was too
  far away for that to be true. The next year, he published a book,
  <i>De Stella Nova</i>, which reported his observations. (Most
  scientific discussion at the time went on in Latin, which let
  professors and thinkers from different countries communicate in a
  common language. This was beneficial, although it did exclude most
  people from the scientific process. Anyone who couldn't speak Latin
  was basically shut out from scientific discoveries.  Latin was so
  common in intellectual communities that even college students spoke
  it; Paris's Left Bank has a section called the Latin Quarter thanks
  to all the college-related people who lived there.) Our modern word
  "nova" comes from Tycho's book title. Any "nova" is a star which
  shines more brightly than usual for some stretch of time. The star
  might be too dim to see until it goes nova, at least without a good
  telescope. Logically, a "supernova" is a star which bursts out with
  even greater power.</p>

  <p>In 1600, Tycho gained an assistant of sorts, the talented
  mathematician <a href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kepler.html">Johannes
  Kepler</a> (1571-1630).  Kepler, who we usually call by his last
  name, was not as skilled as Tycho when it came to making
  observations on the sky. However, he was remarkably gifted at
  geometry and was ideally suited to making sense out of the
  observations Tycho had recorded. They differed in many respects and
  had considerable trouble getting along. Kepler was an avid
  Copernican; along with <a href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html">Galileo
  Galilei</a> (1564-1642) he believed in the Polish astronomer <a
  href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html">Nicolaus
  Copernicus</a> (1473-1543), who had revived a pre-Aristotle notion
  that the Sun, instead of the Earth, was the center of the
  Universe. Tycho, on the other hand, believed in a model he had
  invented himself, where the Sun and Moon circled the Earth, but all
  other planets circled the Sun. Kepler came from a background
  radically different from Tycho's upper-class youth; his father was a
  mercenary and his mother would be tried for witchcraft.</p>

  <p>After Tycho died, Kepler used his measurements to improve
  Copernicus's theory of the Universe, developing a set of three laws
  which describe the motion of the planets. These laws would help
  future astronomers understand and describe planetary motion, and are so
  accurate that there currently exists programs that can predict with
  astonishing accuracey (exempting any catastrophic type event that
  is largely unpredictable) where astronomical bodies will be at a certain time.
  Programs like <a href="http://www.stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>
  do just that, allowing you to go into the future or past to see
  what astronomers at that time would see. This was an astounding
  accomplishment, which consumed many years of Kepler's life. This
  would be enough to secure him a proud place in the astronomical hall
  of fame; he also had the luck to observe a supernova.</p>

  <p>In 1604, Kepler saw a bright star in the constellation <a
  href="ophiuchus.html">Ophiuchus</a>. His observations, published in
  <i>De stella nova in pede Serpentarii</i>, provided another item of
  evidence against the old Aristotelian belief.</p> <hr />
