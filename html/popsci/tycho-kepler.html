<p align="left"><font size=+1>Despite these problems, the Greek astronomers and most of
the people who listened to them believed that celestial objects were perfect
circles, moving in perfect circles without change for all time. This view
fell apart thanks to the Danish astronomer <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Brahe.html">Tycho
Brahe</a> (1546-1601). Tycho, usually called by his first name, led an
unusual life in many respects. He was born into the upper crust of Danish
nobility. Attending a dance at a professor's house at the University of
Rostack, Germany, he fell into an argument with another aristocrat, Manderup
Parsbjerg. They fought, and Tycho lost his nose. For the rest of his life,
he wore a metal replacement, usually said to be made from silver. According
to legend, he died when good manners forced him to remain at a banquet
table, even though he desperately needed to urinate. After several hours
of this torture, his bladder burst.</font><font size=+1></font></p>

<p><font size=+1>(<a href="http://www.griffithobs.org/IPSHowTychoDied.html">Recent
investigations</a> indicate that Tycho's fatal uremia may have resulted
from mercury poisoning. An alchemist as well as an astronomer, Tycho may
have ingested mercury-rich medicines of his own devising, with less than
beneficial results.)</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Almost thirty years before his unusual demise, Tycho had
shocked Europe. In November of 1572, he was walking home from his uncle's
chemistry laboratory and noticed a new star, shining brightly in the constellation
Casseopeia. We now know that this was a supernova, a massive star that
reached the end of its fuel supply and exploded. Aristotle's astronomy
said that nothing in the heavens really changed; all events that looked
otherwise (comets, falling stars and such) were really just like clouds
or storms, weather happening in the Earth's air. Tycho showed that his
new star was too far away for that to be true. The next year, he published
a book, <i>De Stella Nova,</i> which reported his observations. (Most scientific
discussion at the time went on in Latin, which let professors and thinkers
from different countries communicate in a common language. This was beneficial,
although it did exclude most people from the scientific process. Anyone
who couldn't speak Latin was basically shut out from scientific discoveries.
Latin was so common in intellectual communities that even college students
spoke it; Paris's Left Bank has a section called the Latin Quarter thanks
to all the college-related people who lived there.) Our modern word "nova"
comes from Tycho's book title. Any "nova" is a star which shines more brightly
than usual for some stretch of time. The star might be too dim to see until
it goes nova, at least without a good telescope. Logically, a "supernova"
is a star which bursts out with even greater power.</font>

<p><font size=+1>In 1600, Tycho gained an assistant of sorts, the talented
mathematician <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kepler.html">Johannes
Kepler</a> (1571-1630). Kepler, who we usually call by his last name, was
not as skilled as Tycho when it came to making observations on the sky.
However, he was remarkably gifted at geometry and was ideally suited to
making sense out of the observations Tycho had recorded. They differed
in many respects and had considerable trouble getting along. Kepler was
an avid Copernican; along with <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html">Galileo
Galilei</a> (1564-1642) he believed in the Polish astronomer
<a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html">Nicolaus
Copernicus</a> (1473-1543), who had revived a pre-Aristotle notion that
the Sun, instead of the Earth, was the center of the Universe. Tycho, on
the other hand, believed in a model he had invented himself, where the
Sun and Moon circled the Earth, but all other planets circled the Sun.
Kepler came from a background radically different from Tycho's upper-class
youth; his father was a mercenary and his mother would be tried for witchcraft.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>After Tycho died, Kepler used his measurements to improve
Copernicus's theory of the Universe, developing a set of three laws which
describe the motion of the planets. This was an astounding accomplishment,
which consumed many years of Kepler's life. This would be enough to secure
him a proud place in the astronomical hall of fame; he also had the luck
to observe a supernova.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>In 1604, Kepler saw a bright star in the constellation
<a href="ophiuchus.html">Ophiuchus</a>. His observations, published in
<i>De
stella nova in pede Serpentarii</i>, provided another item of evidence
against the old Aristotelian belief.</font><font size=+1></font>
