    Supernova Burst Movies</h1>

<p><a href=SNmovie3D/> 3D Movie</a> depicts what the data would look like if you
could see the events happening while looking into the detector.
<p><a href=SNmovieEXTRA/> Unrolled view movie</a> shows the same data, but unrolled
to make it easier to analyze and with some graphs showing collected data on the sides.

    <p>The final versions of these movies are by Cully Little; they incorporate
work by Steve Farrell and Ben Reed. 
The 3D movie makes use of the tscan event display (primary
author Tomasz Barsczak) and both have made use of Super-K collaboration software tools.
These movies show what the Super-K detector sees, a large number of little <i>blips</i>
on its radar. The way it sees these is not by seeing the actual neutrinos themselves,
but instead by seeing events happen <i>because</i> of a neutrino. Basically, if something
happens within the detector, Super-K is able to detect it. What you're seeing in
the movies are every single event that it detects, which can then be broken down
into data and observed later on.

<p>In a relavent context, if Super-K were to think that a neutrino burst from
a supernova was happening, it'd be because there would be a sharp increase in the
number of events taking place. Something similar to this (most detectors have different
looks or set-ups but ultimately get similar results) would appear in other detectors as well,
with the actual size of the burst depending on how big the detector actually is.
At this point they all automatically send out an alert, and if enough alerts are recieved,
SNEWS sends out the alert to let people know a supernova is coming.
