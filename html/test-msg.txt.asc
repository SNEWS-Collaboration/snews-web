Hash: SHA1

This is a test of your SNEWS signature verification.

This is not a supernova alarm.  But, it uses the same signature as
an alarm would use, so please make sure your email client can
verify the signature as legitimate.

See http://snews.bnl.gov/signatures.html for some links
to how you might make this happen at the email client level.  You will
also need a working copy of either PGP or GnuPG (GPG) on your system
to do the actual crypto work once your email client has the right hooks
to feed it this message.
