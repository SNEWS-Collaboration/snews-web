    <br />
    SuperNova Early Warning System</h1>

    <p>World-wide, several detectors currently running or nearing completion are sensitive to a core collapse
    supernova neutrino signal in the Milky Way. The neutrino signal emerges promptly from a supernova's core,
    whereas it may take hours for the first photons to be visible. Therefore, the detection of the neutrino
    burst from the next Galactic supernova can provide an early warning for astronomers. Putting several
    detectors in coincidence can provide the astronomical community with a very high confidence early warning
    of the supernova's occurrence. In addition, the SNEWS alarm may be able to serve as a trigger for
    detectors which are not able to trigger on a supernova signal by themselves, allowing extra data to be
    saved.</p>

    <p>The SNEWS project involves an international collaboration of experimenters representing current
    supernova neutrino detectors. In addition, gravitational wave detectors will be involved. The goal of
    SNEWS is to provide the astronomical community with a prompt alert of the occurrence of a Galactic core
    collapse event. We are also engaged in cooperative inter-experiment work, such as downtime coordination
    and inter-experiment timing verification, designed to optimize global sensitivity to a core collapse
    supernova signal.</p>
