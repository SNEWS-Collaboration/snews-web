    <p> SNEWS is upgrading!

    <h2>  Here is the <a href=https://snews2.org/>SNEWS 2.0 website</a>


    <p> SNEWS 1.0 will continue to run until SNEWS 2.0 is launched.
    <h3><a href=https://snews2.0.snolab.ca>SNEWS 2.0 Workshop:</a>
    Supernova Neutrinos in the Multi-Messenger Era,  Sudbury, June 14-17, 2019</h3>

    
    <p>
World-wide, several detectors currently running or nearing completion
are sensitive to a core-collapse supernova neutrino signal in the
Milky Way. The neutrino burst signal emerges promptly from a
supernova's core, whereas it may take hours for the first photons to
be visible. Therefore, the detection of the neutrino burst from the
next Galactic supernova can provide an early warning for astronomers.
Requiring a coincident signal from several detectors will provide the
astronomical community with a very high confidence early warning of
the supernova's occurrence. In addition, a neutrino burst alert may be
able to serve as a trigger for detectors that are not able to trigger
on a supernova signal by themselves, allowing extra data to be saved.

<p> The SNEWS project involves an international collaboration of
experimenters representing current supernova-neutrino-sensitive
detectors.  The goal of SNEWS is to provide the astronomical community
with a prompt alert of the occurrence of a Galactic core-collapse
event. We are also engaged in cooperative inter-experiment work, such
as downtime coordination, to optimize global sensitivity to a
core-collapse supernova signal.

<p>SNEWS has been running in automated mode since 2005.  Currently,
seven neutrino experiments are involved: <a href="http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/index-e.html">Super-K</a>
(Japan), <a href="http://www.bo.infn.it/lvd/">LVD</a> (Italy),
<a href="http://icecube.wisc.edu/">Ice Cube</a> (South Pole), <a href=http://www.awa.tohoku.ac.jp/kamlande/> KamLAND</a>
(Japan), <a href=http://borex.lngs.infn.it/> Borexino</a>
(Italy) <a href="https://www.km3net.org">KM3NeT</a> (Mediterranean),
<a href="https://www.snolab.ca/halo/">HALO</a> (Canada). Anyone wishing to receive a prompt SNEWS alert may sign
up for the <a href="mailinglists.html">mailing list</a>.    No
nearby core collapses have occurred since SNEWS started running, but
we are ready for the next one.

<p> Is Betelgeuse going to blow up soon?  We'd love that, but <a href=https://twitter.com/Sydonahi/status/1209061726601273344/photo/1>probably not! </a> If it does though, we'll be ready.
