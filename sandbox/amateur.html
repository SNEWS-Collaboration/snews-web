<p><br><font size=+1>SNEWS may be your chance to make a significant contribution
to science! Be the first to pinpoint a rare Galactic supernova and make
early observations!</font>
<p><font size=+1>In the event of a supernova, neutrino detectors may yield
limited information about where the supernova source is (in the best case,
it may be a few degrees; in the worst case there could be no pointing information
at all.). Therefore amateurs, with their wide viewing capabilities, may
well be the first to find the supernova and point more powerful telescopes
to the event. Very early data taken by amateurs themselves may be of prime
importance, too. Because Galactic supernovae are so rare (a few per century),
it will be especially crucial to see the very early turn-on of the light.
The time between the neutrino burst warning and the first visible light
could be minutes, hours or days, depending on the nature of the stellar
envelope and the amount of obscuration.</font>

If you receive a SNEWS alert, get out there and look!</font></center>

<p><font size=+1><i><a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/" target="new_window">Sky
and Telescope</a></i> provides an
<a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/proamcollab/astroalert/article_332_1.asp" target="new_window">AstroAlert</a>
service for notification of amateurs. It will also serve as a clearinghouse
for amateur observations, so that information about the direction of a
supernova can be disseminated as soon as possible to other observers, including
professionals.</font>
<p><font size=+1>You may also sign up to be notified directly by SNEWS:
please look <a href="alert.html">here</a> for information on how to sign
up. However, we recommend that amateur observers sign up for AstroAlert,
and report observations via the <i>Sky and Telescope</i> feedback system
(the
<i>Sky and Telescope</i> folks are experts on observational astronomy;
we are primarily neutrino physicists and won't know what to do with your
material!).</font>
