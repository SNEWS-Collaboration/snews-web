<p align="center">Ancient Astronomy</p>

<p>The Greek astronomer <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">
Hipparchus</a> (c. 190 BCE--c. 120 BCE) was born in Nicaea, a city in
what is now Turkey.  In the year 135 BCE, he was stargazing and saw a
bright point of light he didn't recognize.  The constellation Scorpio
had a new star which neither Hipparchus nor anyone he knew had ever
seen before.  Was it genuinely new, or had he just overlooked it
before?  To make sure he didn't miss anything else, he decided to map
all the stars in the sky.  Once he had a map showing all known stars,
any unfamiliar one could simply be checked against the map, instantly
telling whether or not it was a new object in the sky.

<p>Hipparchus had a problem making his star chart.  It was easy enough
to map the surface of the Earth, because the Earth has landmarks:
rivers, mountains, cities--places of known location, to which other
places can be compared.  The sky, however, has no landmarks, just the
stars themselves.  Hipparchus decided to invent "landmarks" of his
own.  He picked one point in the sky and drew imaginary lines
radiating out from it, like the spokes of a wheel.  Then he drew
circles around this central point which grew larger and larger.  This
made a grid around the sky, on which Hipparchus could locate any star
he wanted.  This idea soon improved Earthly map-making as well: the
modern lines of longitude and latitude come directly from Hipparchus's
method of mapping the sky.  Instead of locating stars on the
"celestial sphere" (the entire area visible around the Earth), later
map-makers drew gridlines on their charts of the Earth's sphere.  Many
modern globes show these lines, one set (the <i>meridians</i>)
radiating out from the North Pole and the other going around the other
way, parallel to the Equator.  Today, the sky's "North Pole" is near
(but not exactly on) the star Polaris, in the constellation Ursa Minor
(the "Little Bear").

<p>Hipparchus never confirmed whether the bright light he saw was
truly a new star.  Because no one knew exactly what he had seen, most
Greek astronomers believed that nothing beyond the Earth changed.
According to <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristotle.html">
Aristotle</a> (384 BCE-322 BCE), one of the most famous Greek
scientists, everything in the regions outside the Earth was perfect
and eternally unchanging.  All objects in the heavens were supposed to
be perfect circles, except for stars, which were featureless points of
light.

<p>This view had problems from the beginning.  We all know about the "Man
in the Moon", a collection of bright and dark spots which makes the
Moon look like it has a picture on it.  Different cultures describe
the shape differently (a woman with an umbrella, a rabbit, or a man's
face) but everyone can see something is there that's not a perfect,
featureless circle.  While the Sun is too bright to view directly, at
sunrise and sunset it becomes larger and dimmer.  Occasionally, at
these times one can see spots on its surface, dark regions against the
orangish-red of the solar disk.  These "sunspots" can be seen more
easily by shining the sun's light through a telescope onto a piece of
paper.

<p>After the Roman Empire conquered the early scientific center of
Alexandra in Egypt, science in Europe and the Mediterranean regions
went into a decline. (We consider Alexandria to be part of Greek
culture, rather than Egyptian, because it was founded by the conqueror
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander
the Great</a> (356 BCE-323 BCE). Alexander conquered so many nations
that he spread Greek culture as far as northern India.  The years
following his death are called the "Hellenistic age", <i>Hellenes</i>
being the name the Greeks gave themselves.)  The last important
Alexandrian scientist was Hypatia (c. 370 CE-415 CE), who was murdered
by a mob of fanatical monks.  Some accounts indicate her flesh was
scraped from her bones with oyster shells.  For many centuries, the
Chinese and Japanese were the world's foremost astronomers.  While in
Europe learning stagnated, first during the Roman Empire and then into
the "Dark Ages" which followed the Empire's collapse, Japanese and
Chinese astronomers recorded the events going on in the heavens.

<p>Arab nations also played a significant role in preserving scientific
knowledge throughout these dark times.  The caliph Al-Mansur (712-715), the
founder of Baghdad, initiated a drive to copy all the surviving
ancient Greek books and translate them into Arabic.  This
knowledge--the sum total the ancient world understood of astronomy,
biology, mathematics, medicine and physics--remained unknown in Europe
until mercenary knights defeated the Arab provinces in Spain.

<p>While Asian astronomers were making careful observations, European
astronomy had degenerated into primitive notions of astrology,
treating anything and everything in the sky as omens of disaster.  For
example, in 1066 CE, a comet appeared and moved through the
constellations.  Europe went into widespread panic.  A
Norman aristocrat, Guillaume le Batard, who ruled lands in the north
of France, used this fear to his advantage.  He made the comet into a
propaganda weapon, saying it was an omen foretelling the defeat of his
enemy, King Harold of England.  Guillaume conquered England the year
the comet appeared, his Norman army defeating Harold's Saxon one at
the bloody Battle of Hastings.  Ever since, we have known Guillaume by
the Englishified version of his name, William.  ("le Batard",
referring to William's illegitimate birth, has also been changed to
the more dignified "the Conqueror".)

<p>In the year 1054 CE, sky-watchers in Asia reported a bright light
in the constellation Taurus.  For several weeks, it shone brightly
enough to be visible during daylight.  Almost incredibly, European
records show nearly no indication that such a dazzling event ever
occured.  We can only speculate how the Europeans managed to be so
amazingly unobservant.  Perhaps the old Aristotelian ideas, demanding
that the sky be changeless, had too much power, and the people who did
notice the star forced themselves to ignore it.  Or maybe it was just
too cloudy.  (L. A. Marschall proposed an interesting theory: for many
years, the Christian churches in Rome and in Constantinople had been
vehemently arguing the finer points of theology.  The conflict came to
a head in July 1054; just two weeks after the supernova became
visible, Pope Leo IX excommunicated the Patriarch of the Eastern
Orthodox Church.  Since astronomical events were treated as omens of
disaster, Marschall argues, perhaps the summer of 1054 wasn't the best
time to be recording unusual new stars.  Like many theories, this
speculation is difficult to disprove.)

Anasazi observers, Native Americans living in what is now
Arizona and New Mexico, may also have noticed the 1054 supernova.  A
few <a
href="http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/outside/chaco/nebula.html">
petroglyphs</a> are all they left behind, but that is more substantial
than the European records.  Chinese astronomers called this new light,
and others like it, "guest stars".  These guest stars, <i>kohsing</i>
in Mandarin, started invisible and grew brighter, sometimes lasting
months before fading away again.

<p>We know the Chinese were not mistaken because we can see the debris
these stellar events left behind.  Where they reported their guest
star, modern astronomers see the <a
href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m001.html">Crab Nebula</a>, a
cloud of gas thrown out by an exploding star.
