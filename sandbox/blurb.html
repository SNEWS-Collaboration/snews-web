<font color="#FFFFFF">The SuperNova Early Warning System: Brief Description</font></h2></center>
<font size=+1>When a massive star collapses at the end of its life, most
of its binding energy is emitted in the form of neutrinos. These neutrinos
come in all flavors and emerge promptly from the stellar envelope, over
a timescale of tens of seconds. If the star later explodes, the burst of
supernova photons does not become visible until hours laters. Therefore
the observation of a neutrino burst can provide a warning for astronomers
that the opportunity for a rare and valuable observation of the early turn-on
of supernova light may be soon be presenting itself.</font>

<td><font size=+1>A number of neutrino experiments with sensitivity to
a gravitational collapse event in our Galaxy are currently online, or will
be in the future. The <a href="frames.links.html">list</a> includes Super-Kamiokande,
SNO, LVD, KamLAND, AMANDA, Borexino, mini-BOONE, and Icarus, as well as
some proposed experiments such as OMNIS and LAND. In addition, gravitational
wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo have sensivity to asymmetrically collapsing
supernovae.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font size=+1>The basic idea of the early supernova alert project is
to have a central computer (or computers) which accepts neutrino burst
candidate messages from neutrino detectors around the world and sends an
alarm message to astronomers if it finds a coincidence within a short period
of time (10 seconds). Currently, there are two SNEWS coincidence computers,
one at the Super-Kamiokande site in Mozumi, Japan, and one at Gran Sasso.
Super-Kamiokande and LVD are are online in "automated mode"-- alert messages
from each experiment are sent immediately. SNO, KamLAND, AMANDA are also
involved at different levels. The coincidence is "blind", i.e. is done
without polling other experiments if one message is received.</font>
