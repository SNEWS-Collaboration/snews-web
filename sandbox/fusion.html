<p>A typical supernova can glow as brightly as an entire galaxy of a
hundred billion stars, pouring out as much energy as our Sun will in
its entire lifetime in a few months.  To understand where this
fantastic amount of energy comes from, it helps to understand where
stars derive their normal energy supply, during the many millions of
years their lives can last.  Before the year 1896, scientists did not
even have a candidate for the Sun's energy source, for the simple
reason that no phenomenon then known could provide that much energy
for that long.  Were the Sun composed entirely of a chemical fuel like
coal, for example--and if it also had the oxygen necessary to burn the
coal, of course--it would go dark in a few thousand years.  Hermann
von Helmholtz (1821-1894) proposed the idea that the Sun was
contracting under its own gravitational pull, heating up as its own
weight pulled its gases into a tighter and tighter ball.  When he
calculated how long <i>this</i> process would last, he discovered that
the Sun could only have begun glowing at its present intensity some
70,000 years ago.  This was worrisome, and not just because it implied
that the Sun would die out comparatively soon, too: geologists
studying the Earth's past had already decided that the planet was
<i>at least</i> tens of millions of years old.  Fossils of extinct
animals like dinosaurs, already known to be millions of years old,
clearly showed that the Earth was habitable at that time period, with
the Sun performing then much as it does today.  What could possibly
power the Sun for those countless epochs, possibly upwards of a
billion years?

<p><b>Radioactivity</b></p>

<p>In 1896, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered that a mineral
containing the element <i>uranium</i> released energy, at a steady
rate, for prolonged periods of time.  A crystal of uranium mineral
could fog a photographic plate, even if the plate were wrapped in dark
cloth to block all visible light.  In the following years, other
elements were discovered which had the same effect, some even more
strongly than uranium itself.  The Polish physicist and chemist Marie
Slodowska Curie (1867-1934) coined the term <i>radioactivity</i> to
describe these elements' peculiar property.  Working with a uranium
ore known as pitchblende (mined, it happens, in the mountains of
Bohemia), Marie and her husband Pierre Curie discovered that the ore
was more radioactive than the uranium within it could account for.
They deduced the presence of additional radioactive elements, more
intensely radioactive than uranium.  In July 1898, they isolated one
of these elements, which they named <i>polonium</i>; in December of
the same year, they isolated a still more radioactive element named
<i>radium</i>.  This work won them the 1903 Nobel Prize (the third
ever given) in Physics, which they shared with Becquerel.  For her
work on polonium and radium, Marie won a second Nobel, this time in
Chemistry, in 1911.  (Her husband, Pierre, had by that time sadly been
killed in a traffic accident.)

<p>The radioactivity of these minerals was the first indication that an
energy source existed which was more powerful than chemical reactions.
Radium, for example, glows in the dark, with practically undiminished
intensity, for much longer than a human lifetime.  Pierre Curie
measured radium's rate of heat release to be 590 joules (140 calories)
per hour for every gram of radium, enough to warm 1 cc of water 2.3
degrees Celsius every minute.  What's more, radium maintains this heat
rate not just for hours or days, but <i>centuries</i>: after 1600
years, the heat-emission rate is still half of its original value.

<p>When this discovery became known, it rapidly found an application in
industry.  The hands of watches, and the numbers on their dials, were
soon painted with radium compounds, which glowed a greenish color
bright enough to be read at night.  Sadly, the same radioactivity
which produced this useful illumination--and which fogged photographic
plates, as Becquerel had shown--also produced deleterious effects upon
the human body.  At the same time the Curies were working, the Dutch
botanist Hugo Marie De Vries (1848-1935) described the phenomenon of
<i>mutations</i>: he observed that the offspring of American evening
primrose flowers (which had been introduced into the Netherlands in
the 1880s) were sometimes noticeably different from the parent plants
that had produced the seeds.  De Vries observed traits in the flowers
which appeared suddenly in one generation without having been visible
in earlier ones, and he concluded that random factors must be
producing changes in the flowers' genetic material.  By 1927, the
American biologist Hermann Muller (1890-1967) had shown conclusively
that radiation, including X-rays and the emissions produced by
radioactive minerals, sharply increased the rate of mutations.  Most
mutations, scientists discovered, were harmful to the organism they
affected, frequently robbing the organism of the ability to conduct
some necessary chemical function.  Frequently, mutations are
<i>carcinogenic</i>; that is, the genetic changes they involve lead to
the uncontrolled cellular growth we call cancer.  Muller, having
discovered this harmful consequence of radiation, publicized his
knowledge widely and fought for strong precautions on the handling of
radiation--but his efforts were too late for the workers who had
already developed serious health problems licking the brushes they'd
used to paint radium onto watch dials.

<p>Now, even when Pierre Curie made his measurements in 1901, it was
fairly clear that neither the Sun nor any other visible star obtained
its energy from radium.  (For one thing, the Sun doesn't glow green
like a painted watch dial!)  However, it was still evident that
somewhere within the atoms of these elements there lurked a potent
energy source, one which could pour out heat and light for centuries
without noticeable diminishment.  The study of radioactivity led to
many astonishing breakthroughs in our understanding of the atom; in
terms of pure knowledge, it is certainly one of the most significant
discoveries of the last several centuries.  (The fact that the last
sixty years have seen us use this knowledge to develop weapons capable
of annihilating our own species and much besides may make the
discovery of radioactivity more significant still.)

<p><b>Atomic Structure</b></p>

<p>The picture of the atom we have today, developed largely thanks to
intensive study of radioactivity, is as follows.  The center of each
atom is a lump of material, known as the <i>atomic nucleus</i>, which
contains almost all of the atom's mass and carries a positive electric
charge.  By the 1930s, it was known that the nucleus is composed of
<i>protons</i>, which are positively charged and give the nucleus its
overall electric properties, and <i>neutrons</i>, which are
electrically neutral and therefore do not "feel" the effects of
electric fields.  (This made neutrons difficult to detect.)  The outer
regions of each atom--in fact the vast majority of the atom's volume-- 
are occupied by <i>electrons</i>, particles much lighter than either
protons or neutrons, which carry a negative electric charge.  In the
normal state of affairs, the number of electrons in the outer regions
equals the number of protons in the nucleus; since the size of the
charge each particle carries is equal, the overall charge of the atom
balances out to zero.

<p>It is frequently said that electrons "orbit" the nucleus, in much the
same way that planets orbit the central star of their star system.
This is a useful image for studying certain aspects of atomic
behavior, but it is by no means a complete picture.  By the late
1910s, for example, it was deduced that electrons could only "orbit"
the nucleus at certain fixed distances, whereas (in principle) a
planet could orbit the Sun in a circle of any radius.  By 1928, it was
well established that objects as small as protons, neutrons and
electrons--in fact, anything on the sub-atomic scale--behave in a
fundamentally different way than the entities with which we are
familiar, which are made of many trillions of atoms.  (A liter of
something as insubstantial as ordinary air, for example, contains
roughly 2.68x10<sup>22</sup> or 26,800,000,000,000,000,000,000
molecules, most of which are the two-atom nitrogen molecule
N<sub>2</sub>.)  Thanks principally to Erwin Schroedinger (1887-1961)
and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), we have a mathematical way of
describing this kind of subatomic behavior, a system called <i>quantum
mechanics</i>.  Countless experiments have shown that the world really
<i>is</i> quantum-mechanical, when observed closely enough, but that
doesn't make quantum behavior any more intuitive.  (The physicist
Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was fond of observing that, though the
newspapers once claimed "only twelve men understand Einstein's Theory
of Relativity", it wasn't really true: once people read Einstein's
work, they probably understood it to some degree.  Quantum mechanics,
on the other hand, <i>nobody</i> understands, even though scientists
are able to use it to make calculations.)  Schroedinger's prescription
for doing quantum mechanics, which lets us compute numerical answers
for questions we pose, involves a quantity we call the "wave
function".  Essentially, if we want to know where in an atom we might
find an electron, we imagine a sort of "cloud" which is denser in some
regions than in others.  This "cloud"--the wave function--tells us
that we are most likely to observe the electron in the regions where
the cloud is thickest.  Before we actually make an observation, we can
only know the <i>probability</i> that the electron is in one place or
another.  The shape of the wave function is influenced by electric
fields or other forces; the familiar notion that like charges repel
and opposite charges attract becomes, in quantum mechanics, a formula
for the shape of the wave function, which we call <i>Schroedinger's
Equation</i>.

<p>Schroedinger was able to calculate the different ways electrons can
"inhabit" the space around an atom.  With quantum-mechanical
calculations as a background, it is possible to show that ordinary
chemical reactions (combustion, rusting, or even the biochemical
interactions inside living organisms) result from interactions among
the electrons in the outer reaches of atoms.  Atoms may "share"
electrons, for example, forming a bond between them.  Alternatively,
one or more electrons may be removed entirely from one atom and
donated to another. The donor atom, stripped of its electrons, has a
net positive charge, while the recipient gains a net negative charge.
Because opposite charges attract, these atoms can be bound together
quite tightly.  Large numbers of atoms, held together in such a
fashion, can form structures difficult to disrupt.  Ordinary table
salt is an example: it is a crystal made of negative chloride ions
(chlorine atoms with one extra electron) and positive sodium ions
(which have lost one electron).  The "electrostatic" force holding
these ions together makes table salt ("sodium chloride") a crystal
which is difficult to melt.

<p>The bonds formed by these electron interactions are, however,
relatively weak.  The shared-electron bonds which hold together the
hydrogen and oxygen in water (H<sub>2</sub>O), for example, can be
broken by an electric current supplied by a small battery.  Put
another way, it doesn't take much energy to disrupt a shared-electron
bond.  (Bonds produced by the <i>transfer</i> of electrons from atom
to atom, such as those in salt crystals, are stronger, but can still
be broken by electricity or chemical reactions.)  

<p>There is not much energy involved in rearrangeing the pattern of
electrons around the nucleus, particularly when compared to the amount
involved with altering the <i>nuclear</i> structure itself.  To grasp
the difference, note that ordinary chemical explosives like dynamite
or TNT involve breaking shared-electron bonds to release energy.
Nuclear weapons work by rearranging the protons and neutrons
<i>inside</i> the nucleus (more details will follow, but this is the
key notion).  How much is the difference?  Well, the <i>first time</i>
we tried to blow something up using a nuclear "device", a few
kilograms of material produced a blast equivalent to fifteen thousand
<i>tons</i> of TNT.  We have become more clever since then;
technological advances have led to what Feynman (himself a group
leader at Los Alamos) liked to call a "worse bomb".

<p><b>Fission and Fusion</b></p>

There are two primary ways nuclear reactions can produce energy.  The
first, which is familiar to us from Earthly radioactivity, involves
large atomic nuclei splitting apart.  The second, in which small
nuclei are put together, is the mechanism which powers the stars.  We
call the joining of small nuclei into larger ones <i>fusion</i>, and
we use the term <i>fission</i> to cover cases where large nuclei split
into pieces.

<p>Of the two processes, fusion produces most of the energy we see in
the Universe, and is also responsible for the variety of chemical
elements we find in the world around us.  However, fission was the
first nuclear process human beings learned how to control.

<p>You may have noticed something odd about the picture of the atom
described earlier: if like charges repel each other, and opposite
charges attract, what keeps the protons in the nucleus--who all have
the same charge--from flying apart?  This is a real difficulty, and it
puzzled scientists for many years.  At first, they believed that the
nucleus contained a few electrons, whose negative charge helped
neutralize the protons' positive charge, making a kind of "cement"
that held the nucleus together.  Eventually, though, further
experiments showed that the nucleus contained neutrons instead;
because the neutron carries no electric charge, it cannot hold the
nucleus together by electrical forces.

<p>This still leaves the possibility that some <i>other</i> force
exists, some force which operates between protons and neutrons and
makes them attract each other.  Because this force must be strong
enough to overcome the protons' electrical repulsion, scientists
termed it the <i>strong nuclear force</i>.  (There is also a weak
nuclear force, which behaves in a different way, but we needn't worry
about it just yet.)  We now have a fairly good understanding of the
way the strong force operates, though <i>why</i> such a force exists
in the first place is still an unanswered question.

<p>The strong force can hold a small nucleus together very tightly.
For example, the helium-4 nucleus, consisting of two protons and two
neutrons, is a very stable unit.  Larger nuclei, however, can be too
big for the strong force to hold together.  Sometimes, a large nucleus
may "shed" small pieces.  Because it is the number of protons in the
atom which indicates what element the atom is, a nucleus emitting
particles in this fashion changes the atom's chemical identity.
Often, a heavy nucleus will emit a unit of two protons and two
neutrons, all bound together, which is identical to the nucleus found
in helium-4 (the most common variety of helium).  This group is often
called an </i>alpha particle,</i> a name invented before the
particle's nature was known.  (Early investigations of radioactivity
led to the discovery of several kinds of radiation, which scientists
named after the first letters in the Greek alphabet.  This is kind of
a running pattern:  we find scientists talking about alpha and beta
subunits in proteins, alpha and beta carbon atoms in molecules, and so
on.  As it turned out, beta rays are speeding electrons, released from
the nucleus itself, and gamma rays are photons, or particles of
light--but light of an extremely short wavelength, on the scale of the
atomic nucleus itself.)

<p>Sometimes, instead of merely emitting smaller particles, a heavy
nucleus will react in a more radical way.  If we take an atom of
uranium-238, for example, and "whack" it with a neutron, the neutron
may impact the U-238 nucleus, pushing it into an "excited" state,
which then splits apart, releasing extra neutrons and extra energy.
The extra neutrons released in this reaction are not themselves
energetic enough to cause other U-238 atoms to fission.  However,
natural uranium consists of a mixture of isotopes, including one with
three fewer neutrons per nucleus known as U-235.  If we strike a
U-<i>235</i> nucleus with a neutron, it may also fission, but unlike
U-238, nuclei of U-235 <i>can</i> be broken apart by the neutrons
fission releases.  Therefore, if the U-235 atoms are packed together
tightly enough, so that too many neutrons do not escape to the
outside, we may witness a <i>chain reaction,</i> in which one fission
event causes several more, which in turn cause many more, building up
to a fantastic release of energy.

<p>Uranium is not the only "fissile" element.  Plutonium, discovered
in nuclear-reactor products in 1940, also works quite well.  (The
elements uranium, neptunium and plutonium were named after the planets
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which were in turn named after <a
href="http://www.theoi.com">ancient Greco-Roman gods</a>.)  Many
elements, even if they aren't actually suitable for chain reactions
(and therefore nuclear fission bombs), break up into smaller pieces.
Generally speaking, the more unstable an isotope, the less likely one
will find it occuring naturally "in the wild".  This is why, for
example, technetium (element number 43) is so rare that it was
produced in a lab before it was ever seen in nature: no isotope of
technetium is stable enough to have survived the 4.5 billion years
since the Earth formed.  It can be extracted, however, from used
nuclear fuel rods.  (See this, fairly comprehensive <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium">article</a> and the
references therein.)

<p>How did human beings first manufacture technetium?  The answer will
lead us to the second type of nuclear reaction, since it involves the
putting-together of smaller nuclei.  In 1937, Carlo Perrier and Emilio
Segre (1905-1989) bombarded molybdenum atoms (element number 42) with
deuterium nuclei--that is, with "heavy hydrogen" nuclei having one
proton <i>and</i> one neutron apiece.  When a "deuteron" approaches a
molybdenum nucleus, the positive charge of the molybdenum nucleus
makes the deuteron split apart.  The proton gets pushed away, but the
uncharged neutron feels no electric repulsion, so it impacts the Mo
nucleus and causes a reaction.  (Why not bombard with neutrons in the
first place?  The positive charge of the deuteron provides a
convenient "handle" for accelerating the particles, which is much more
difficult to arrange with uncharged neutrons.)  The neutron impact
causes a nuclear reaction, which produced two different technetium
isotopes, Tc-95 and Tc-97.

<p>By 1929, <a href="spectroscope.html">spectral analysis</a> had shown
that the Sun is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, in a 3:1 ratio
by mass.  In that year, the physicist George Gamow (1904-1968)
suggested that, in the intense pressures and temperatures within the
Sun's core, four hydrogen nuclei could fuse together to make one
helium nucleus.  The excess energy of this reaction would be,
ultimately, what makes the Sun shine.  In later years, Gamow's ideas
were refined, particularly by Carl Weizsacker (b. 1912) and <a
href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1967/bethe-bio.html">Hans
Bethe</a> (1906-2005).  It is this theory of nuclear fusion which
answered Helmholtz's original question, providing a mechanism which
could power the Sun's radiation for literally billions of years.


<p><i>Under Construction. . .</i></p>

<p><b>Binding Energies</b></p>

<p>Stars, including our own Sun, produce heavy elements by smashing
together the nuclei of lighter ones.  Here, we will look at how this
process operates, and what conditions constrain the production of new
elements.

<p>To understand nuclear reactions in more detail, we use Einstein's
equation <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i>.  When we combine protons and
neutrons to make a nucleus, the final nucleus is <i>lighter</i> than
the sum total of the individual particles' masses.  The difference,
the so-called "mass defect", goes into an <i>energy</i>, the energy of
the strong-force bonds holding the nucleus together.

<p>A fusion reaction requires some amount of energy to go, which
depends upon the specific nuclei being fused.  Since all positive
charges repel, we must put energy into the reaction, pushing the
nuclei together against their electric repulsion.  The more strongly
charged the nuclei, the more energy this requires; therefore, we
expect heavier elements with more protons to be harder to fuse.  In
chemists' language, we have to overcome the "activation energy", a
sort of "hill" which we must climb over to reach the final state (a
fused nucleus).

The high activation energy for nuclear fusion reactions implies that
fusion is a high-temperature process.  What we call "heat" is, on the
atomic scale, the motion of atoms:  the kinetic energy of their motion
appears to us as the "thermal energy" of the substance.  The higher
the temperature, the faster the atoms are moving; to achieve fusion,
the temperature must be sufficiently high that atoms impact strongly
enough to overcome their electrical repulsion.  In other words, the
<i>thermal energy</i> must be large enough to overcome the
<i>activation energy</i>.  (At these temperatures, the electrons are
stripped off the atoms, leaving a "soup" of bare nuclei and free
electrons zinging about, a state of matter we call a <i>plasma</i>.)

<p>A fusion reaction can also <i>release</i> energy:  suppose we
combine some small nuclei, which each have some mass defect, to make a
larger nucleus, which will have its own characteristic mass defect.
The <i>conservation of mass-energy</i> states that the total mass-energy
cannot change--mass may convert to energy and vice versa, but the 
total remains fixed.  Therefore, since the mass defects are not likely
to be exactly the same, we expect to find some "excess mass", which
must exist to balance the equation.

<p align="center"><i>M</i><sub>protons</sub> + <i>M</i><sub>neutrons</sub>
- (mass defect of small nuclei)
= <i>M</i><sub>protons</sub> + <i>M</i><sub>neutrons</sub>
- (mass defect of large nucleus) + (excess)
</p>

<p>We can subtract the mass of the protons and neutrons from each
side.  The excess mass is given by the difference of mass defects:

<p align="center">(excess) = (mass defect of large nucleus)
 - (mass defect of small nuclei)<p>

<p>By Einstein's equation, this excess mass shows up as an amount of
energy.  Scientists typically write a change in a quantity using the
Greek letter &Delta;, "delta", so a change of energy can be written
&Delta;<i>E</i>.

<p align="center">&Delta;<i>E</i> = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>
 * ((mass defect of large nucleus - (mass defect of small nuclei)).
</p>

<p>If &Delta;<i>E</i> is larger than the activation energy (the energy
required to make the reaction go), then the fusion reaction can be
self-sustaining, with the output from one fusion event fueling the
next.  The excess above and beyond the activation energy can show up
as heat, light or other radiation.  Therefore, <i>the fusion reactions
in stars are governed by the mass defects of the elements</i>.

<p>By convention, scientists speak of "binding energies", which are
really just mass defects times <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.  What, then,
determines the binding energies of the different elements?  This
depends upon the interplay between the electromagnetic and the strong
nuclear forces.  As mentioned earlier, the positively charged protons
all repel one another.  The electromagnetic force is what we call an
"inverse-square" interaction:  its strength drops off with the
<i>square</i> of the distance between charges.  If the distance
between protons is doubled, the repulsive force weakens by a factor of
2<sup>2</sup> = 4.  If the distance is increased by a factor of 10,
the force drops to 1/100 of its previous value.  The sizes of atomic
nuclei, however, are small enough that all the protons can essentially
"feel" each other.  The "electrostatic" energy due to all these
repulsive forces therefore grows without limit as the nuclei get
larger and larger.

<p>On the other hand, the strong nuclear force is a "short-range"
interaction.  Protons and neutrons only "feel" a strong-force effect
due to their immediate neighbors.  Interestingly, the strong force
attraction between a proton and a neutron is the same as that between
two protons or between two neutrons.  (A physicist would say, "The
strong force is <i>symmetric</i> under exchanges of protons and
neutrons.")  We can therefore lump both kinds of particles under one
term, "nucleons".  Inside the nucleus, nucleons have partners on all
sides, but those nucleons on the surface have partners on only one
side.  A larger nucleus, with more "room" on the inside compared to
its surface area, has comparatively more attractive bonds, so the
attractive strong-force binding energy increases with nuclear size (up
to a point).

<p>These two contributions have opposing effects, one attractive and
the other repulsive.  The overall result is that the binding energy
per nucleon increases as the nucleus size goes up, until we reach the
element iron, at which point it goes down again.

<p>This implies that <i>elements heavier than iron cannot fuse
spontaneously</i>.  It "costs more" to squeeze two heavy nuclei
together than the reaction can produce.  It is physically possible to
do this, but the reaction requires more energy than it can supply, and
in nature it only happens when another reaction produces a large
surplus of energy.

<p><b>Producing the Elements</b></p>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, the activation energy is larger for reactions
involving bigger nuclei, since the more protons we have, the more
electric repulsion we will encounter as we bring the nuclei close
together.  This means that reactions with light nuclei, particuarly
hydrogen and helium, are the easiest to achieve.  Fusion can occur
with heavier elements, all the way up to iron, but as we indicated
earlier, fusing iron soaks up more energy than it gives out.

<p>The mass of a star is the single most important criterion for
determining what elements it will fuse, how long it will fuse them,
and consequently, how long the star will "live".  A star's life begins
when a cloud of gas (a <i>nebula</i>) contracts under its own gravity,
pulling together and warming up until the pressure and temperature at
its center is great enough to initiate nuclear fusion.  A <i>brown
dwarf</i>, with a mass seventy or so times that of the planet Jupiter,
can manage to fuse deuterium (heavy hydrogen), but not the ordinary
hydrogen isotope.  This requires more mass.

<p>A star with about the mass of the Sun (<i>i.e.,</i> with about "1
solar mass" of material) spends most of its existence fusing hydrogen
to make helium.  Three helium nuclei can, in turn, be fused into a
carbon nucleus.  (Other reactions, involving two helium nuclei or a
hydrogen-plus-helium combinations, lead to unstable nuclei which break
down again.)  When a star in this mass range nears the end of its
life, it has accumulated enough helium to begin fusing that helium
into carbon.  The extra energy produced by helium fusion causes the
star to expand, radically:  when the Sun enters this phase, four
billion years or so from now, it will swell to engulf the orbits of
Mercury, Venus and perhaps Earth.  Stars in this phase are known as
<i>red giants</i>, thanks to their color.  Their surfaces are
relatively cool (and therefore radiate red light, by Planck's
blackbody law), but because of their large total surface area, they
can be very bright.

<p>A star with one solar mass of material cannot sustain fusion past
this point.  Eventually, it will exhaust its helium supply (in much
less time than it spent fusing hydrogen to make helium).  The red
giant will then collapse, leaving a shell of gas and a very small,
tightly packed central remnant, a "white dwarf" mostly made of
carbon.  The white dwarf glows with the leftover energy of the star,
but it does not sustain fusion of its own.  In a white dwarf, atoms
are packed extremely closely together, so much so that they
"degenerate":  nuclei are so small compared to atoms that atoms are
mostly empty space, but in white-dwarf material this empty space is
filled.

<p>Consider a star with several times the mass of the Sun.  Such a
star can achieve fusion of heavier elements, including carbon and
beyond.  However, it exhausts its fuel supply in less time:
<i>heavier stars are shorter lived</i>.  A one-solar-mass star can
"survive" for ten billion years, while heaver stars "die" in a
thousandth of that time.  Their death throes are also more impressive.

<p>This table shows the "burning" process for a star of twenty solar
masses.  (We hasten to clarify that nuclear fusion is <i>not</i> the
same thing as burning ordinary fuel, which is a chemical reaction
involving electrons in the outer regions of atoms, and which delivers
much less energy.  However, astronomers and astrophysicists feel free
to speak about stars "burning hydrogen" or "burning helium", and as
long as we keep the basic physics in mind, there really isn't much
chance of confusion.)  Note that the initial "burning" stage, in which
hydrogen is fused into helium, is by far the longest, enduring about
eight million years.

<p>As time progresses, a massive star comes to resemble a
nuclear-fusion onion, with reactions progressing in layers.  The very
center of the star will be "burning" the heaviest elements, with
lighter nuclei "burning" in successive layers, out from the center.
We might find, for example, a core in which oxygen fuses to silicon
and sulfur, surrounded by layers in which neon fuses to oxygen and
magnesium, carbon fuses to neon and magnesium, and so forth.

<p>The process ends, as advertised, with iron (Fe).  What happens when
the star builds up a core of iron?  In brief, a catastrophe: the iron
(which exists in a gaseous plasma state, like all elements within the
hot star) soaks up more energy than fusing it can produce.  Stifled at
its heart, the star cannot hold itself up against its own gravity.
(It is the thermal energy of these large stars which keeps them from
collapsing under their own weight, and this thermal energy requires
constant fusion to maintain.)  When the iron chokes off its energy
source, the star collapses.

<p>We have never had the chance to see what happens next up close, or
even from a safe distance of several tens of light-years.  The only
such events which have been witnessed using modern observing
technology have occured in other galaxies.  Scientists are, therefore,
still guessing about some of the details.  What we do know is the
following:

<p>The collapse of the star triggers an explosion as bright as an
entire galaxy, which can glow for weeks.  About 10<sup>46</sup> joules
of energy are released as <a href="neutrino.html">neutrinos</a>, and
about one one-hundredth of this (10<sup>44</sup> joules) becomes the
visible explosion.  This number is so large that illustrative
analogies are hard to find: the first atomic bombs (those used at
Alamogordo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki) released about 10<sup>14</sup>
joules.  The fusion "devices" produced in later years can be a
thousand times more powerful than the original fission-powered bombs,
but Nature still does better, by about twenty-nine zeroes before the
decimal point.

<p>Such a blast is called a <i>Type II supernova</i>.  Astronomers
have observed other types of large stellar explosions, which they sort
into other categories.  The primary division, between type I and type
II, is made using <a href="spectroscope.html">spectroscopy</a>: type
II supernova show hydrogen lines in their spectra, and type I do not.
Supernovae are classified into subcategories (Ia, Ib and so forth)
based upon finer details of their spectra and the shapes of their
<i>light curves</i>, that is, how they grow bright and dim again over
time.

(HarperCollins: 2005).  Gonick and Criddle lay out how electrons work
to make bonds and determine the properties of materials.  This book is
mostly dedicated to chemistry on Earth, but remarkably enough, the
same information applies to chemistry in space.

(Addison-Wesley: 1989).  See volume 1, chapters 15 and 16 for
Einstein's theory of relativity (and how it relates to bombs); chapter
37 for the groundwork of quantum mechanics; and chapter 22 for an
explanation of what all the math you ever studied was <i>really</i>
about.
