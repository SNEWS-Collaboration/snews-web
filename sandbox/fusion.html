<p>A typical supernova can glow as brightly as an entire galaxy of a
hundred billion stars, pouring out as much energy as our Sun will in
its entire lifetime in a few months.  To understand where this
fantastic amount of energy comes from, it helps to understand where
stars derive their normal energy supply, during the many millions of
years their lives can last.  Before the year 1896, scientists did not
even have a candidate for the Sun's energy source, for the simple
reason that no phenomenon then known could provide that much energy
for that long.  Were the Sun composed entirely of a chemical fuel like
coal, for example--and if it also had the oxygen necessary to burn the
coal, of course--it would go dark in a few thousand years.  Hermann
von Helmholtz (1821-1894) proposed the idea that the Sun was
contracting under its own gravitational pull, heating up as its own
weight pulled its gases into a tighter and tighter ball.  When he
calculated how long <i>this</i> process would last, he discovered that
the Sun could only have begun glowing at its present intensity some
70,000 years ago.  This was worrisome, and not just because it implied
that the Sun would die out comparatively soon, too: geologists
studying the Earth's past had already decided that the planet was
<i>at least</i> tens of millions of years old.  Fossils of extinct
animals like dinosaurs, already known to be millions of years old,
clearly showed that the Earth was habitable at that time period, with
the Sun performing then much as it does today.  What could possibly
power the Sun for those countless epochs, possibly upwards of a
billion years?

<p><b>Radioactivity</b></p>

<p>In 1896, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered that a mineral
containing the element <i>uranium</i> released energy, at a steady
rate, for prolonged periods of time.  A crystal of uranium mineral
could fog a photographic plate, even if the plate were wrapped in dark
cloth to block all visible light.  In the following years, other
elements were discovered which had the same effect, some even more
strongly than uranium itself.  The Polish physicist and chemist Marie
Slodowska Curie (1867-1934) coined the term <i>radioactivity</i> to
describe these elements' peculiar property.  Working with a uranium
ore known as pitchblende (mined, it happens, in the mountains of
Bohemia), Marie and her husband Pierre Curie discovered that the ore
was more radioactive than the uranium within it could account for.
They deduced the presence of additional radioactive elements, more
intensely radioactive than uranium.  In July 1898, they isolated one
of these elements, which they named <i>polonium</i>; in December of
the same year, they isolated a still more radioactive element named
<i>radium</i>.  This work won them the 1903 Nobel Prize (the third
ever given) in Physics, which they shared with Becquerel.  For her
work on polonium and radium, Marie won a second Nobel, this time in
Chemistry, in 1911.  (Her husband, Pierre, had by that time sadly been
killed in a traffic accident.)

<p>The radioactivity of these minerals was the first indication that an
energy source existed which was more powerful than chemical reactions.
Radium, for example, glows in the dark, with practically undiminished
intensity, for much longer than a human lifetime.  Pierre Curie
measured radium's rate of heat release to be 590 joules (140 calories)
per hour for every gram of radium, enough to warm 1 cc of water 2.3
degrees Celsius every minute.  What's more, radium maintains this heat
rate not just for hours or days, but <i>centuries</i>: after 1600
years, the heat-emission rate is still half of its original value.

<p>When this discovery became known, it rapidly found an application in
industry.  The hands of watches, and the numbers on their dials, were
soon painted with radium compounds, which glowed a greenish color
bright enough to be read at night.  Sadly, the same radioactivity
which produced this useful illumination--and which fogged photographic
plates, as Becquerel had shown--also produced deleterious effects upon
the human body.  At the same time the Curies were working, the Dutch
botanist Hugo Marie De Vries (1848-1935) described the phenomenon of
<i>mutations</i>: he observed that the offspring of American evening
primrose flowers (which had been introduced into the Netherlands in
the 1880s) were sometimes noticeably different from the parent plants
that had produced the seeds.  De Vries observed traits in the flowers
which appeared suddenly in one generation without having been visible
in earlier ones, and he concluded that random factors must be
producing changes in the flowers' genetic material.  By 1927, the
American biologist Hermann Muller (1890-1967) had shown conclusively
that radiation, including X-rays and the emissions produced by
radioactive minerals, sharply increased the rate of mutations.  Most
mutations, scientists discovered, were harmful to the organism they
affected, frequently robbing the organism of the ability to conduct
some necessary chemical function.  Frequently, mutations are
<i>carcinogenic</i>; that is, the genetic changes they involve lead to
the uncontrolled cellular growth we call cancer.  Muller, having
discovered this harmful consequence of radiation, publicized his
knowledge widely and fought for strong precautions on the handling of
radiation--but his efforts were too late for the workers who had
already developed serious health problems licking the brushes they'd
used to paint radium onto watch dials.

<p>Now, even when Pierre Curie made his measurements in 1901, it was
fairly clear that neither the Sun nor any other visible star obtained
its energy from radium.  (For one thing, the Sun doesn't glow green
like a painted watch dial!)  However, it was still evident that
somewhere within the atoms of these elements there lurked a potent
energy source, one which could pour out heat and light for centuries
without noticeable diminishment.  The study of radioactivity led to
many astonishing breakthroughs in our understanding of the atom; in
terms of pure knowledge, it is certainly one of the most significant
discoveries of the last several centuries.  (The fact that the last
sixty years have seen us use this knowledge to develop weapons capable
of annihilating our own species and much besides may make the
discovery of radioactivity more significant still.)

<p><b>Atomic Structure</b></p>

<p>The picture of the atom we have today, developed largely thanks to
intensive study of radioactivity, is as follows.  The center of each
atom is a lump of material, known as the <i>atomic nucleus</i>, which
contains almost all of the atom's mass and carries a positive electric
charge.  By the 1930s, it was known that the nucleus is composed of
<i>protons</i>, which are positively charged and give the nucleus its
overall electric properties, and <i>neutrons</i>, which are
electrically neutral and therefore do not "feel" the effects of
electric fields.  (This made neutrons difficult to detect.)  The outer
regions of each atom--in fact the vast majority of the atom's volume-- 
are occupied by <i>electrons</i>, particles much lighter than either
protons or neutrons, which carry a negative electric charge.  In the
normal state of affairs, the number of electrons in the outer regions
equals the number of protons in the nucleus; since the size of the
charge each particle carries is equal, the overall charge of the atom
balances out to zero.

<p>It is frequently said that electrons "orbit" the nucleus, in much the
same way that planets orbit the central star of their star system.
This is a useful image for studying certain aspects of atomic
behavior, but it is by no means a complete picture.  By the late
1910s, for example, it was deduced that electrons could only "orbit"
the nucleus at certain fixed distances, whereas (in principle) a
planet could orbit the Sun in a circle of any radius.  By 1928, it was
well established that objects as small as protons, neutrons and
electrons--in fact, anything on the sub-atomic scale--behave in a
fundamentally different way than the entities with which we are
familiar, which are made of many trillions of atoms.  (A liter of
something as insubstantial as ordinary air, for example, contains
roughly 2.68x10<sup>22</sup> or 26,800,000,000,000,000,000,000
molecules, most of which are the two-atom nitrogen molecule
N<sub>2</sub>.)  Thanks principally to Erwin Schroedinger (1887-1961)
and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), we have a mathematical way of
describing this kind of subatomic behavior, a system called <i>quantum
mechanics</i>.  Countless experiments have shown that the world really
<i>is</i> quantum-mechanical, when observed closely enough, but that
doesn't make quantum behavior any more intuitive.  (The physicist
Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was fond of observing that, though the
newspapers once claimed "only twelve men understand Einstein's Theory
of Relativity", it wasn't really true: once people read Einstein's
work, they probably understood it to some degree.  Quantum mechanics,
on the other hand, <i>nobody</i> understands, even though scientists
are able to use it to make calculations.)  Schroedinger's prescription
for doing quantum mechanics, which lets us compute numerical answers
for questions we pose, involves a quantity we call the "wave
function".  Essentially, if we want to know where in an atom we might
find an electron, we imagine a sort of "cloud" which is denser in some
regions than in others.  This "cloud"--the wave function--tells us
that we are most likely to observe the electron in the regions where
the cloud is thickest.  Before we actually make an observation, we can
only know the <i>probability</i> that the electron is in one place or
another.  The shape of the wave function is influenced by electric
fields or other forces; the familiar notion that like charges repel
and opposite charges attract becomes, in quantum mechanics, a formula
for the shape of the wave function, which we call <i>Schroedinger's
Equation</i>.

<p>Schroedinger was able to calculate the different ways electrons can
"inhabit" the space around an atom.  With quantum-mechanical
calculations as a background, it is possible to show that ordinary
chemical reactions (combustion, rusting, or even the biochemical
interactions inside living organisms) result from interactions among
the electrons in the outer reaches of atoms.  Atoms may "share"
electrons, for example, forming a bond between them.  Alternatively,
one or more electrons may be removed entirely from one atom and
donated to another. The donor atom, stripped of its electrons, has a
net positive charge, while the recipient gains a net negative charge.
Because opposite charges attract, these atoms can be bound together
quite tightly.  Large numbers of atoms, held together in such a
fashion, can form structures difficult to disrupt.  Ordinary table
salt is an example: it is a crystal made of negative chloride ions
(chlorine atoms with one extra electron) and positive sodium ions
(which have lost one electron).  The "electrostatic" force holding
these ions together makes table salt ("sodium chloride") a crystal
which is difficult to melt.

<p>The bonds formed by these electron interactions are, however,
relatively weak.  The shared-electron bonds which hold together the
hydrogen and oxygen in water (H<sub>2</sub>O), for example, can be
broken by an electric current supplied by a small battery.  Put
another way, it doesn't take much energy to disrupt a shared-electron
bond.  (Bonds produced by the <i>transfer</i> of electrons from atom
to atom, such as those in salt crystals, are stronger, but can still
be broken by electricity or chemical reactions.)  

<p>There is not much energy involved in rearrangeing the pattern of
electrons around the nucleus, particularly when compared to the amount
involved with altering the <i>nuclear</i> structure itself.  To grasp
the difference, note that ordinary chemical explosives like dynamite
or TNT involve breaking shared-electron bonds to release energy.
Nuclear weapons work by rearranging the protons and neutrons
<i>inside</i> the nucleus (more details will follow, but this is the
key notion).  How much is the difference?  Well, the <i>first time</i>
we tried to blow something up using a nuclear "device", a few
kilograms of material produced a blast equivalent to fifteen thousand
<i>tons</i> of TNT.  We have become more clever since then;
technological advances have led to what Feynman (himself a group
leader at Los Alamos) liked to call a "worse bomb".

<p><b>Fission and Fusion</b></p>

There are two primary ways nuclear reactions can produce energy.  The
first, which is familiar to us from Earthly radioactivity, involves
large atomic nuclei splitting apart.  The second, in which small
nuclei are put together, is the mechanism which powers the stars.  We
call the joining of small nuclei into larger ones <i>fusion</i>, and
we use the term <i>fission</i> to cover cases where large nuclei split
into pieces.
