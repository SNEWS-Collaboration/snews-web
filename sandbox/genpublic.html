Early Warning System(SNEWS)</span><br> <br>

Our project, once in full swing, will be able to detect if a star goes
supernova.  Although it may sound like a doomsday prevention project,
the real purpose is expansion of scientific knowledge.  The event of a
supernova is rare; furthermore, no one has yet seen the earliest
stages of one taking place.<br> <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why do Neutrinos Matter?</span><br> <br> <div
style="text-align: left;">

Stars can end their lives in astounding ways. If one has enough mass,
it will collapse in on itself causing an explosion.  We call this
event a supernova. The end arrives when all the fuel in the star is
burnt up.  The process of a supernova does not happen in an instant;
it takes about ten seconds.  When the star does go supernova, it
releases a fantastic amount of energy, often making the dying star
shine as brightly as an entire galaxy.  The supernova's brilliance may
equal that of a hundred billion average stars, yet this is not even
the majority of the energy the explosion emits.  Most of the blast's
power goes off in the form of subatomic particles we call neutrinos. 
Neutrinos are very small particles and are virtually massless.  They
do not interact very well with mass or anything else.  A more detailed
description of neutrinos is located at the 
<a href="http://www-boone.fnal.gov/publicpages/Appell_nus.html"> Neutrino
Info</a> website.  <br>

Where this all comes together is that the  visible light that
is emitted from a supernova cannot escape the shockwave from the
explosion.  The nutrinos are out of the system before the light is. 
The time that nutrinos arrive to any destination before any of the
visble light gets to the same varies from a few minutes to a few
days.  Detectors all over the world will be set up to make sure to
sort out a real supernova from the inevitable background noise.<br>
</div> <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How are neutrinos detected if they do
not interact with anything?</span><br>

<br>
Just because they don't interact with matter very well doesn't mean
that they don't; it is a rare event, but it does occur.  Many neutrino
detectors follow this basic plan, although details vary from
experiment to experiment.  A giant container is filled with matter,
the most popular kind being water (which is relatively cheap and has
various nice propeties), and is surrounded by photomultipliers,
detector tubes capable of sensing very dim flashes of light.  Whenever
a neutrino hits the matter, some form of light results.  The
photomultipliers catch any small amount of light which might be
emitted.  Once the light signal is recorded for computers to study, we
can determine which way the neutrino came from and other important
properties.  For further information of detectors and how they will
detect neutrinos, visit SNEWS's <a

detectors</a> page.<br> <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What if the project gets a
hit?</span><br> <br>

The first part of the project is an automated watch system will be set
up for two things: 1) to sort out a real event from the background
noise, and 2) to report this event to the project's human members.  If
the data SNEWS receives represents the real deal, then the automated
system will send out a message to all amateur astronomers and SNEWS
staff.  "Why amateur astronomers?"  Amateurs actually contribute more
to sceince than people may realize.  They are very flexible observers;
professionals need too much time to set up, to redirect their massive
telescopes twoard a particular spot.   The amateur astronomers
have a vast knowedge of space, so if a certain star is out of order
they will know.  "Why is an automated system check needed?"  The
automated system is put in place to reduce as much human time as
possible.  Rather than having people on watch sending emails and/or
messages to everyone signed up for a SNEWS hit, the computer can
handle the job, doing it much faster.<br> <br>

How accurately will SNEWS locate a supernova in the sky?  We can't
honestly tell until we find one.  Estimates range from very great to
very grim; we might spot an exploding star and pinpoint it within a
few degrees, or we might not be able to specify its direction at all.
This is part of the fun:  if we knew going in what we could do, there
would scarcely be a point to doing it.  As practical experimenters, we
plan for the worst:  we build error checks into our software, we try
to construct fail-safe detectors, and we invent contingency plans for
the event that we find a supernova burst but cannot ascertain its
location in the sky.  We expect, prudently, that things will go
wrong.  On the other hand, as scientists we can also hope for the
best: the rewards of pure knowledge SNEWS can bring--the thrill
of catching a dying star--is enough to warrant driving ahead.

Even if you are a person of science, you still get to believe in
luck.<br> <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Have there ever been any recorded
supernovae?</span><br>

<br>
    Yes. Sixteen years ago, a star went supernove in a galaxy called
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Named Supernova 1987A, the
explosion was so bright that a telescope wasn't needed to see it. 
(Granted, it helped tremendously to have one, but the stellar
explosion was so powerful that even the naked eye could spot it.)  Go
to this page for <a
href="http://www.thehubbletelescope.com/Supernova1987A.html">pictures
from the Hubble telescope</a> of the supernova.  For additional
scientific explanation of the nova go to the <a
href="http://cosmos.colorado.edu/astr1120/l6S6.htm">Sceintific
Analysis of SN1987A</a> site.  Fair warning: this site contains a
hefty amount of scientific jargon.  (Over the years, scientists have
invented many thousands of words which exactly express what they try
to say, as long as they're talking to a fellow scientist.  This is
usually a good thing; after all, would you want your doctor to try
treating your illness when he can only describe it as "a funny feeling
in the tummy"?  For doctors and astronomers alike, those long strings
of syllables have real meaning, which can make it hard to boil their
speech down into everyday language.)<br> <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What about our star, the
sun?</span><br> <br>

Our own home star will not go supernova.  It takes a star of a mass 
roughly eight times as much as our sun to end in that dramatic
fashion.  Our sun will eject a sphere of helium gas and become a kind
of remnant we call a planetary nebula.  Will this happen any time
soon?  No, not by our everyday standards.  It will be around 5 billion
years from now before our sun becomes a red giant, which is the final
stage before the sun would die.  To put this another way, you have
time to watch eighty-seven trillion, six hundred billion
(87,600,000,000,000) American sitcom TV shows before the sun runs out
of nuclear fuel.  This is a long way away for anybody.  You shouldn't
cancel your Friday dinner plans, but you might like to think about it,
just to keep a bad day in perspective.<br> <br>
