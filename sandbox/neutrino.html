<p><b>The Neutrino</b> is a subatomic particle famous for its ability to slip
through matter without interacting.  Neutrinos have none of the
"handles" by which most other particles affect one another: no
electric charge, almost zero mass.  They are so elusive that a
light-year of lead, nine and one-half trillion kilometres (six
trillion miles) would only stop half of the neutrinos flying through
it.  The only hope for detecting them is to put a large quantity of
matter in one place and hope the occasional neutrino will, by dumb
luck, strike an atom somewhere and interact with it.  Because so many
other radiation sources are releasing energy throughout the Universe,
any detector trying to spot neutrinos has to deal with backgroud
noise.  Picking the signal out of this noise can be a challenge.  To
make the problem easier, neutrino detectors are built underground,
often within deep mineshafts.  The rock around the detector blocks any
radiation not powerful enough to penetrate beneath the Earth; because
neutrinos are so "slippery", they can pass through the rock and reach
the detector device.

<p>Neutrinos are valuable to astronomers precisely because they are so
evasive.  Since even large thicknesses of matter don't have much
effect, neutrinos can flow right through things which distort or block
other types of radiation.  For example, our Sun is a ball of hot
gases, 1,392,000 kilometres (870,000 miles) in diameter.  Nuclear
fusion reactions at the Sun's core heat these gases, producing vast
quantities of energy.  We would like to know the details of what's
going on inside the Sun's core, but the gaseous layers in the way
block our view.  The gas atoms scatter light so well that a single
photon, the basic particle of light, takes roughly fifty thousand
years to reach the Sun's surface.  Photons leave the core, hit nearby
atoms, bounce off them, hit other atoms, and spend centuries doing
more and more of the same, until they manage to leak out in the
thinner regions near the surface.  All that scattering and jostling
obscures the details of the interior, just like a bright city skyline
looks vague and indistinct when observed through a thick fog.
Neutrinos avoid this problem, because they don't like to interact with
the Sun's atoms.  Once nuclear reactions in the core produce
neutrinos, they can radiate away and rapidly escape the Sun.  Neutrino
detectors, then, can tell us what happens deep within the solar core,
because they bring us information directly from the source.  In the
city analogy's terms, they zip through the fog and reveal the
metropolis behind it.

<p>The neutrino entered physics as the brainchild of <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pauli.html">
Wolfgang Pauli</a> (1900-1958).  Pauli was trying to explain a
puzzling feature of beta decay, a type of nuclear reaction that
frequently occurs in unstable heavy elements.  In beta decay, a
neutron within the atomic nucleus breaks down and turns into a proton,
releasing an electron which flies away from the atom.  Measurements
showed that the electron's energy varied:  sometimes it barely crept
out of the nucleus's pull, and sometimes it shot away at high speed.
Physicists could explain the high-energy case fairly easily: the
electron simply carried the maximum energy the reaction could
produce.  What about the lower-energy cases, Pauli wondered.

<p>A basic principle, the <b>Conservation of Energy,</b> says that energy
cannot vanish from existence.  It cases where that appears to happen,
it is in fact being transformed into a less obvious form.  (To a
physicist, watching energy vanish from a situation is like how many
people feel watching money disappear from their bank account.)  For
example, when you throw a broken computer out the window, the Earth's
gravity gives it a certain amount of energy, which shows up as the
computer's speed.  The higher it begins, the more energy and hence
speed it gains by the time it hits the sidewalk below.  When it
impacts the ground, though, where does all that energy go?  Answer:
the <i>kinetic</i> energy the falling computer had from its motion
went into <i>thermal</i> energy (both computer and sidewalk are a
little warmer than before) and <i>acoustic</i> energy (the crash makes
a sound).  Also, some goes into distorting the shape of the computer,
which (among other things) puts <i>potential</i> energy into bending
pieces of metal and plastic.

<p>What kind of phenomenon could carry away the energy the electron
didn't use?  Pauli dreamt up a new particle, an entity which would
pick up the slack, so to speak.  It would have to be hard to detect,
elusive enough to explain why no one had seen it before.  Pauli
decided the particle would have no electric charge, and that it would
be very light, either totally massless or almost so.  He named his
particle the <i>neutrino</i>, from an Italian word meaning "little
neutral one".

<p>A later discovery, flavor change, complicates this issue somewhat.
From the mid-1960s, when the solar neutrino flux was first measured,
up until about 2002, the "solar neutrino problem" caused much debate.
All detectors confirmed a puzzling result:  the Sun was only emitting
one-third to one-half of the neutrinos we expected.  Large amounts of
cleverness have gone into solving this problem, and developments in
the past few years have been very exciting.
