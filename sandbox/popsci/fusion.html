<p><font size=+1>Stars, including our own Sun, produce heavy elements by
smashing together the nuclei of lighter ones. Here, we will look at how
this process operates, and what conditions constrain the production of
new elements.</font>
<p><font size=+1>To understand nuclear reactions in more detail, we use
Einstein's equation <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i>. When we combine protons
and neutrons to make a nucleus, the final nucleus is <i>lighter</i> than
the sum total of the individual particles' masses. The difference, the
so-called "mass defect", goes into an <i>energy</i>, the energy of the
strong-force bonds holding the nucleus together.</font>
<p><font size=+1>A fusion reaction requires some amount of energy to go,
which depends upon the specific nuclei being fused. Since all positive
charges repel, we must put energy into the reaction, pushing the nuclei
together against their electric repulsion. The more strongly charged the
nuclei, the more energy this requires; therefore, we expect heavier elements
with more protons to be harder to fuse. In chemists' language, we have
to overcome the "activation energy", a sort of "hill" which we must climb
over to reach the final state (a fused nucleus). The high activation energy
for nuclear fusion reactions implies that fusion is a high-temperature
process. What we call "heat" is, on the atomic scale, the motion of atoms:
the kinetic energy of their motion appears to us as the "thermal energy"
of the substance. The higher the temperature, the faster the atoms are
moving; to achieve fusion, the temperature must be sufficiently high that
atoms impact strongly enough to overcome their electrical repulsion. In
other words, the
<i>thermal energy</i> must be large enough to overcome
the
<i>activation energy</i>. (At these temperatures, the electrons are
stripped off the atoms, leaving a "soup" of bare nuclei and free electrons
zinging about, a state of matter we call a <i>plasma</i>.)</font>
<p><font size=+1>A fusion reaction can also <i>release</i> energy: suppose
we combine some small nuclei, which each have some mass defect, to make
a larger nucleus, which will have its own characteristic mass defect. The
<i>conservation
of mass-energy</i> states that the total mass-energy cannot change--mass
may convert to energy and vice versa, but the total remains fixed. Therefore,
since the mass defects are not likely to be exactly the same, we expect
to find some "excess mass", which must exist to balance the equation.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1><i>M</i><sub>protons</sub> + <i>M</i><sub>neutrons</sub>
- (mass defect of small nuclei) = <i>M</i><sub>protons</sub> + <i>M</i><sub>neutrons</sub>
- (mass defect of large nucleus) + (excess)</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>We can subtract the mass of the protons and neutrons from
each side. The excess mass is given by the difference of mass defects:</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>(excess) = (mass defect of large nucleus) - (mass defect
of small nuclei)</font></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font size=+1>By Einstein's equation, this excess mass shows up as an
amount of energy. Scientists typically write a change in a quantity using
the Greek letter &amp;Delta;, "delta", so a change of energy can be written
&amp;Delta;<i>E</i>.</font>
<center>
<p><font size=+1>&amp;Delta;<i>E</i> = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> * ((mass defect
of large nucleus - (mass defect of small nuclei)).</font></center>

<p><font size=+1>If &amp;Delta;<i>E</i> is larger than the activation energy
(the energy required to make the reaction go), then the fusion reaction
can be self-sustaining, with the output from one fusion event fueling the
next. The excess above and beyond the activation energy can show up as
heat, light or other radiation. Therefore, <i>the fusion reactions in stars
are governed by the mass defects of the elements</i>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>By convention, scientists speak of "binding energies",
which are really just mass defects times <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. What, then,
determines the binding energies of the different elements? This depends
upon the interplay between the electromagnetic and the strong nuclear forces.
As mentioned earlier, the positively charged protons all repel one another.
The electromagnetic force is what we call an "inverse-square" interaction:
its strength drops off with the
<i>square</i> of the distance between charges.
If the distance between protons is doubled, the repulsive force weakens
by a factor of 2<sup>2</sup> = 4. If the distance is increased by a factor
of 10, the force drops to 1/100 of its previous value. The sizes of atomic
nuclei, however, are small enough that all the protons can essentially
"feel" each other. The "electrostatic" energy due to all these repulsive
forces therefore grows without limit as the nuclei get larger and larger.</font>
<p><font size=+1>On the other hand, the strong nuclear force is a "short-range"
interaction. Protons and neutrons only "feel" a strong-force effect due
to their immediate neighbors. Interestingly, the strong force attraction
between a proton and a neutron is the same as that between two protons
or between two neutrons. (A physicist would say, "The strong force is <i>symmetric</i>
under exchanges of protons and neutrons.") We can therefore lump both kinds
of particles under one term, "nucleons". Inside the nucleus, nucleons have
partners on all sides, but those nucleons on the surface have partners
on only one side. A larger nucleus, with more "room" on the inside compared
to its surface area, has comparatively more attractive bonds, so the attractive
strong-force binding energy increases with nuclear size (up to a point).</font>
<p><font size=+1>These two contributions have opposing effects, one attractive
and the other repulsive. The overall result is that the binding energy
per nucleon increases as the nucleus size goes up, until we reach the element
iron, at which point it goes down again.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This implies that <i>elements heavier than iron cannot
fuse spontaneously</i>. It "costs more" to squeeze two heavy nuclei together
than the reaction can produce. It is physically possible to do this, but
the reaction requires more energy than it can supply, and in nature it
only happens when another reaction produces a large surplus of energy.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Producing the Elements</font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>As we mentioned earlier, the activation energy is larger
for reactions involving bigger nuclei, since the more protons we have,
the more electric repulsion we will encounter as we bring the nuclei close
together. This means that reactions with light nuclei, particuarly hydrogen
and helium, are the easiest to achieve. Fusion can occur with heavier elements,
all the way up to iron, but as we indicated earlier, fusing iron soaks
up more energy than it gives out.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The mass of a star is the single most important criterion
for determining what elements it will fuse, how long it will fuse them,
and consequently, how long the star will "live". A star's life begins when
a cloud of gas (a <i>nebula</i>) contracts under its own gravity, pulling
together and warming up until the pressure and temperature at its center
is great enough to initiate nuclear fusion. A <i>brown dwarf</i>, with
a mass seventy or so times that of the planet Jupiter, can manage to fuse
deuterium (heavy hydrogen), but not the ordinary hydrogen isotope. This
requires more mass.</font>
<p><font size=+1>A star with about the mass of the Sun (<i>i.e.,</i> with
about "1 solar mass" of material) spends most of its existence fusing hydrogen
to make helium. Three helium nuclei can, in turn, be fused into a carbon
nucleus. (Other reactions, involving two helium nuclei or a hydrogen-plus-helium
combinations, lead to unstable nuclei which break down again.) When a star
in this mass range nears the end of its life, it has accumulated enough
helium to begin fusing that helium into carbon. The extra energy produced
by helium fusion causes the star to expand, radically: when the Sun enters
this phase, four billion years or so from now, it will swell to engulf
the orbits of Mercury, Venus and perhaps Earth. Stars in this phase are
known as
<i>red giants</i>, thanks to their color. Their surfaces are relatively
cool (and therefore radiate red light, by Planck's blackbody law), but
because of their large total surface area, they can be very bright.</font>
<p><font size=+1>A star with one solar mass of material cannot sustain
fusion past this point. Eventually, it will exhaust its helium supply (in
much less time than it spent fusing hydrogen to make helium). The red giant
will then collapse, leaving a shell of gas and a very small, tightly packed
central remnant, a "white dwarf" mostly made of carbon and oxygen. The
white dwarf glows with the leftover energy of the star, but it does not
sustain fusion of its own. In a white dwarf, atoms are packed extremely
closely together, so much so that they "degenerate": nuclei are so small
compared to atoms that atoms are mostly empty space, but in white-dwarf
material this empty space is filled.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Consider a star with several times the mass of the Sun.
Such a star can achieve fusion of heavier elements, including carbon and
beyond. However, it exhausts its fuel supply in less time:
<i>heavier stars
are shorter lived</i>. A one-solar-mass star can "survive" for ten billion
years, while heaver stars "die" in a thousandth of that time. Their death
throes are also more impressive.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This table shows the "burning" process for a star of twenty
solar masses. (We hasten to clarify that nuclear fusion is <i>not</i> the
same thing as burning ordinary fuel, which is a chemical reaction involving
electrons in the outer regions of atoms, and which delivers much less energy.
However, astronomers and astrophysicists feel free to speak about stars
"burning hydrogen" or "burning helium", and as long as we keep the basic
physics in mind, there really isn't much chance of confusion.) Note that
the initial "burning" stage, in which hydrogen is fused into helium, is
by far the longest, enduring about eight million years.</font>

<p><font size=+1>As time progresses, a massive star comes to resemble a
nuclear-fusion onion, with reactions progressing in layers. The very center
of the star will be "burning" the heaviest elements, with lighter nuclei
"burning" in successive layers, out from the center. We might find, for
example, a core in which oxygen fuses to silicon and sulfur, surrounded
by layers in which neon fuses to oxygen and magnesium, carbon fuses to
neon and magnesium, and so forth.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The process ends, as advertised, with iron (Fe). What
happens when the star builds up a core of iron? In brief, a catastrophe:
the iron (which exists in a gaseous plasma state, like all elements within
the hot star) soaks up more energy than fusing it can produce. Stifled
at its heart, the star cannot hold itself up against its own gravity. (It
is the thermal energy of these large stars which keeps them from collapsing
under their own weight, and this thermal energy requires constant fusion
to maintain.) When the iron chokes off its energy source, the star collapses.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We have never had the chance to see what happens next
up close, or even from a safe distance of several tens of light-years.
The only such events which have been witnessed using modern observing technology
have occured in other galaxies. Scientists are, therefore, still guessing
about some of the details. What we do know is the following:</font>
<p><font size=+1>The collapse of the star triggers an explosion as bright
as an entire galaxy, which can glow for weeks. About 10<sup>46</sup> joules
of energy are released as <a href="neutrino.html">neutrinos</a>, and about
one one-hundredth of this (10<sup>44</sup> joules) becomes the visible
explosion. This number is so large that illustrative analogies are hard
to find: the first atomic bombs (those used at Alamogordo, Hiroshima and
Nagasaki) released about 10<sup>14</sup> joules. The fusion "devices" produced
in later years can be a thousand times more powerful than the original
fission-powered bombs, but Nature still does better, by about twenty-nine
zeroes before the decimal point.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Such a blast is called a <i>Type II supernova</i>. Astronomers
have observed other types of large stellar explosions, which they sort
into other categories. The primary division, between type I and type II,
is made using <a href="spectroscope.html">spectroscopy</a>: type II supernova
show hydrogen lines in their spectra, and type I do not. Supernovae are
classified into subcategories (Ia, Ib and so forth) based upon finer details
of their spectra and the shapes of their
<i>light curves</i>, that is,
how they grow bright and dim again over time.</font>
<p><font size=+1><i>Type I supernovae</i> lack hydrogen lines in their
spectra, which presumably means the original star was poor in hydrogen.
They are often due, directly or indirectly, to <i>binary star systems</i>,
in which two stars are in orbit around their common center of gravity.
(This situation resembles the Earth-Moon system, except that the distance
between objects is larger.) If both partners of a binary system form at
the same time, the more massive one will speed through its nuclear fuel
more rapidly, reaching the end of its life cycle sooner. This means that
one star may have collapsed to a white dwarf "ember", slowly radiating
away its leftover energy, while the other is still burning hydrogen and
has not yet begun burning helium--the phase of stellar development astronomers
call the "Main Sequence".</font>
<p><font size=+1>Gravity plays a major role in what happens to binary star
systems. First of all, it is the gravitational attraction between the stars
which binds them into orbit and keeps them from flying apart into space.
Second, it may happen that one star's gravity draws gases off the other
star, draining away the second star's outer layers and adding mass to the
first star. Recalling the "onion" model of massive stars, we expect these
outer regions to be mostly hydrogen. If a partner star strips away the
hydrogen from a heavy giant star (one which is at least fusing helium to
make carbon), we will be left with a "stub" of the heavy star, a body called
a <i>Wolf-Rayet star</i>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Losing its outer, hydrogen-rich layers does not affect
what happens inside a Wolf-Rayet star. When the WR core begins to "burn"
silicon, it will create an iron buildup, which will choke off the stellar
fusion, just as we discussed above. The WR star will then go supernova,
but the blast will be missing hydrogen, since the WR star's hydrogen was
all drained away! (It is also possible for a star to lose its outer layers
due to a strong "stellar wind": something about the star's interior makes
it "blow off" gases from its surface, thinning the outer regions.)</font>
<p><font size=+1>Supernovae which do not show hydrogen lines and which
also lack a strong silicon signature are thought to be exploding Wolf-Rayet
stars. This category is termed <i>type Ib</i>; there is also a
<i>type
Ic supernova</i>, in which the spectrum has no helium lines (or very weak
ones). We might expect that type Ic explosions are due to WR stars which
have lost their hydrogen <i>and</i> helium layers, so that the outermost
part of the "onion" contains carbon plasma, burning to make neon and magnesium.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Deploying our knowledge of the Latin alphabet, we expect
that having type Ib and Ic supernovae means that astronomers also have
a
<i>type Ia supernova</i> category, and so they do. As with all type I
events, Ia bursts lack hydrogen. Explosions are classified as type Ia if
they lack helium (as with Ic) but have a silicon <i>absorption line</i>
in their spectrum, at about the time when they are the brightest (the "peak"
of the <i>light curve</i>). In <a href="spectroscope.html">spectroscopy</a>,
we speak of "absorption lines" when cooler gas, between our telescope and
the source of the light, absorbs frequencies from the light, making dark
lines across the spectrum. (If the absorbing gas were heated, we would
see bright lines in the same positions as the dark ones we find from the
cool gas.) In a type Ia supernova, therefore, we see cooler silicon atoms,
being illuminated by fusion reactions in material which lacks both hydrogen
and helium. The commonly accepted theory behind this phenomenon involves
a little more subatomic physics, which is why we treat type Ia supernovas
last here.</font>
<p><font size=+1>All subatomic particles fall into two broad categories:
<i>bosons</i>
and <i>fermions</i>. The former group includes particles like the photons
of light, while the latter group includes electrons, neutrinos and the
<i>quarks</i>
which are the inner constituents of protons and neutrons. In general, <i>matter</i>
is made of fermions, while the forces between matter particles involve
bosons. If we gather a large pile of particles together, bosons and fermions
behave in different ways. An indefinitely large number of bosons can gather
together in the same energy state, all occupying more or less the same
location. However, no two fermions can occupy the same vicinity. In the
language of quantum mechanics we discussed earlier, the wavefunctions of
two fermions, say two electrons, do not "like to" overlap. (Technically,
we can "squeeze" two electrons into the same small region, if we have them
spinning in opposite directions, but this is a minor point for our purposes
here. In astrophysics, this detail typically means that we just have a
2 in some equations instead of a 1.)</font>
<p><font size=+1>This effect is not related to the electric repulsion between
electrons, which occurs because they have the same charge. If we had a
new kind of neutral electrons, their fermionic nature would still tend
to keep them apart. The rule which says that fermions do not occupy the
same location (with the same spin) is called the <i>Pauli exclusion principle</i>.
It requires several years of physics to be able to derive the exclusion
principle from any other fact: up until graduate school, physics students
typically treat it as given, and try to understand its effects.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In a white dwarf, as we mentioned earlier, atoms are squeezed
so hard that they lack the empty space present in normal matter. This "degenerate
matter" consists of atomic nuclei, immersed in a "sea" of electrons, all
packed very closely together. Gravity would tend to make this material
collapse still further, under its own weight, but the odd behavior of quantum
particles keeps gravity at bay: the
<i>exclusion principle</i> prevents
white dwarfs from collapsing! In principle, this happens as follows.</font>
<p><font size=+1>When we have a large "sea" of electrons, the exclusion
principle means that their wavefunctions tend to avoid overlapping. (Stated
more precisely, we do not find two electrons with the same spin and the
same velocity.) We have to "squeeze" this electron aggregate to make it
any smaller, doing work against a "force" which is really an effect of
Pauli exclusion. We say that the fermions' distaste for overlapping creates
an "exclusion pressure", which acts to keep the electron sea from shrinking.
The white dwarf is in
<i>equilibrium</i>, balanced between gravity trying
to pull it tighter and exclusion pressure keeping it large.</font>
<p><font size=+1>What happens when gravity is too intense for exclusion
pressure to overcome? Calculating the details of this phenomenon, the Indian
physicist <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1983/chandrasekhar-lecture.html">Subrahmanyan
Chandrasekhar</a> (1910-1995) deduced that any white dwarf with more than
1.44 solar masses will collapse under its own gravitational pull. As with
the case of a type II supernova's iron core, this collapse can trigger
an explosion.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Suppose we have again a binary star system. Imagine that
one of the stars has collapsed into a white dwarf, composed mostly of carbon
(with some oxygen present as well), while the other star continues to burn
its nuclear fuel. If the white dwarf is close enough, it will draw gases
from the larger star, adding mass to itself. This extra mass may push it
pass the 1.44 solar-mass "Chandrasekhar limit". The collapse increases
the pressure inside the dwarf, and (through details not yet fully understood)
a "flame" of fusing carbon and oxygen erupts. The energy of this flame
causes the dwarf to explode, releasing about 10<sup>44</sup> joules and
ejecting matter at speeds of around 10,000 km/s.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This explains the features of type Ia spectra. The explosion
lacks hydrogen and helium lines, since the white dwarf is composed of carbon
and oxygen. The silicon is produced by fusion of the elements in the exploding
dwarf.</font>
<p><font size=+1>All supernovae spread matter into the space around them.
For type Ia bursts, this matter would contain mostly carbon, oxygen and
silicon.
For a <i>type II</i> blast, we find all the elements produced in the "onion"
reactions, all the way up to iron. In addition, the sheer flood of energy
this blast releases allows energetically unfavorable reactions (the kind
which cannot sustain themselves) to occur: the force of the shock wave
can slam together medium-mass nuclei to make elements heavier than iron.
This is the process by which heavy elements are produced and spread throughout
the universe.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Here, we note an interesting fact: the original star for
a type II supernova can have a mass anywhere within a broad range. Even
without knowing the details of the explosion mechanism, we can expect a
fairly broad variability in type II explosions. However, if we look at
type Ia blasts, they are all due to white dwarfs having about 1.44 solar
masses, the Chandrasekhar mass. We might expect that such dwarfs, which
all have roughly the same composition and the same mass, will go "boom"
in roughly the same way. Astronomers exploit this fact by using type Ia
supernovas as "standard candles": because their parent stars are so similar,
type Ia supernovae all have about the same intrinsic brightness. If we
identify a supernova as type Ia (using its spectral features), we can gauge
how far away it is by measuring how bright it appears.</font>
