<p><font size=+1><b>The Neutrino</b> is a subatomic particle famous
for its ability to slip through matter without interacting. Neutrinos
have none of the "handles" by which most other particles affect one
another: no electric charge, almost zero mass. They are so elusive
that a light-year of lead, nine and one-half trillion kilometres (six
trillion miles) would only stop half of the neutrinos flying through
it. The only hope for detecting them is to put a large quantity of
matter in one place and hope the occasional neutrino will, by dumb
luck, strike an atom somewhere and interact with it. Because so many
other radiation sources are releasing energy throughout the Universe,
any detector trying to spot neutrinos has to deal with backgroud
noise. Picking the signal out of this noise can be a challenge. To
make the problem easier, neutrino detectors are built underground,
often within deep mineshafts. The rock around the detector blocks any
radiation not powerful enough to penetrate beneath the Earth; because
neutrinos are so "slippery", they can pass through the rock and reach
the detector device.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>Neutrinos are valuable to astronomers precisely
because they are so evasive. Since even large thicknesses of matter
don't have much effect, neutrinos can flow right through things which
distort or block other types of radiation. For example, our Sun is a
ball of hot gases, 1,392,000 kilometres (870,000 miles) in
diameter. Nuclear fusion reactions at the Sun's core heat these gases,
producing vast quantities of energy.  We would like to know the
details of what's going on inside the Sun's core, but the gaseous
layers in the way block our view. The gas atoms scatter light so well
that a single photon, the basic particle of light, takes roughly fifty
thousand years to reach the Sun's surface. Photons leave the core, hit
nearby atoms, bounce off them, hit other atoms, and spend centuries
doing more and more of the same, until they manage to leak out in the
thinner regions near the surface. All that scattering and jostling
obscures the details of the interior, just like a bright city skyline
looks vague and indistinct when observed through a thick
fog. Neutrinos avoid this problem, because they don't like to interact
with the Sun's atoms.  Once nuclear reactions in the core produce
neutrinos, they can radiate away and rapidly escape the Sun. Neutrino
detectors, then, can tell us what happens deep within the solar core,
because they bring us information directly from the source. In the
city analogy's terms, they zip through the fog and reveal the
metropolis behind it.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>The neutrino entered physics as the brainchild of <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pauli.html">Wolfgang
Pauli</a> (1900-1958). Pauli was trying to explain a puzzling feature
of beta decay, a type of nuclear reaction that frequently occurs in
unstable heavy elements. In beta decay, a neutron within the atomic
nucleus breaks down and turns into a proton, releasing an electron
which flies away from the atom. Measurements showed that the
electron's energy varied: sometimes it barely crept out of the
nucleus's pull, and sometimes it shot away at high speed. Physicists
could explain the high-energy case fairly easily: the electron simply
carried the maximum energy the reaction could produce.  What about the
lower-energy cases, Pauli wondered.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>A basic principle, the <b>Conservation of Energy,</b>
says that energy cannot vanish from existence. It cases where that
appears to happen, it is in fact being transformed into a less obvious
form. (To a physicist, watching energy vanish from a situation is like
how many people feel watching money disappear from their bank
account.) For example, when you throw a broken computer out the
window, the Earth's gravity gives it a certain amount of energy, which
shows up as the computer's speed. The higher it begins, the more
energy and hence speed it gains by the time it hits the sidewalk
below. When it impacts the ground, though, where does all that energy
go? Answer: the <i>kinetic</i> energy the falling computer had from
its motion went into <i>thermal</i> energy (both computer and sidewalk
are a little warmer than before) and <i>acoustic</i> energy (the crash
makes a sound). Also, some goes into distorting the shape of the
computer, which (among other things) puts <i>potential</i> energy into
bending pieces of metal and plastic.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>What kind of phenomenon could carry away the energy
the electron didn't use? Pauli dreamt up a new particle, an entity
which would pick up the slack, so to speak. It would have to be hard
to detect, elusive enough to explain why no one had seen it
before. Pauli decided the particle would have no electric charge, and
that it would be very light, either totally massless or almost so. He
named his particle the <i>neutrino</i>, from an Italian word meaning
"little neutral one".</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>A later discovery, flavor change, complicates this
issue somewhat. From the mid-1960s, when the solar neutrino flux was
first measured, up until about 2002, the "solar neutrino problem"
caused much debate. All detectors confirmed a puzzling result: the Sun
was only emitting one-third to one-half of the neutrinos we
expected. Large amounts of cleverness have gone into solving this
problem, and developments in the past few years have been very
exciting.</font><font size=+1></font>
