<p>Consider a system in which most of the time, nothing happens, but
every once in a while, an event occurs which catches our interest.
Mathematics requires that we specify precisely what we're talking
about, so we list the following properties.

<nl>
    <li>The fact that one event happens does not change the
    probability that another event will happen later.</li>

    <li>If we look at a very narrow time interval, the probability that an
    event happens during that slot is a number.  We can look at any
    time slot this size (say a tenth of a second), and the number will
    be the same for as long as the system continues to operate.</li>

    <li>Looking at narrower and narrower time slots, we can eventually
    find one where the probability of <i>two</i> events happening is
    basically zero.</li>

<p>We might be talking about radioactive nuclei decaying inside a lump of
uranium metal or about snowflakes landing on a park bench.  If we have
any system which obeys these three rules, we can make definite
mathematical statements about it.  For example, we can answer
questions like "How many radioactive nuclei will we expect to see
decay in 10 seconds?" or "What's the longest time we can go
<i>without</i> seeing a snowflake land?"  A process which obeys these
rules is called a <i>Poisson process</i>, and the study of their
behavior forms a branch of mathematics called <i>Poisson statistics</i>.

SimÅÈon Denis Poisson</a> (1781-1840) introduced the probability
concept which bears his name in the book
<i>RecherchÅÈs sur la probabilitÅÈ des jugements en matiÅËre criminelle
et matiÅËre civile</i> (<i>Researches on the Probability of Judgments
in Criminal and Civil Matters</i>), which was published in 1837.  Many
mathematicians built upon this work, the first notable one being the
Russian <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Chebyshev.html">
Pafnuty Chebyshev</a> (1821-1894).

<p>In years past, one of the classic examples statistics textbooks
gave to describe Poisson probabilities had a rather macabre touch.
During 1944 and 1945, Nazi Germany fired 1,358 V-2 rockets at the city
of London.  The V-2, more fully known as <i>Vergeltungswaffe 2</i> or
"Reprisal Weapon 2", was fired from mobile launch sites and had a
range of about 300 kilometres (200 miles).  Until the Nazi engineers
invented a way to guide the V-2 with radio waves, each rocket used a
self-contained guidance system.  A primitive computer made from analog
ciruit parts adjusted the rocket's angle of flight, and when the
rocket ran out of fuel--a time called <i>Brennschluss</i>, from German
words meaning "burnout"--it continued under gravity's influence,
tracing a parabolic trajectory which ended in a crater on Allied
soil.  This guidance system wasn't accurate enough to ensure pinpoint
impacts, but it did destroy lives.

<p>If we examine the distribution of V-2 impacts upon London, we
notice it has several interesting properites.  First, each impact is
independent of the others; a V-2 landing on the city doesn't change
the probability that another would land some time later.  Furthermore,
because the Nazis launched their weapons at a roughly constant rate (a
rate they tried to make as fast as possible), we have a well-defined
average rate of impacts.  Finally, the Nazis had a limited number of
launch sites, each one of which could only be used every so often, so
given a small enough time interval, the probability of two or more V-2
impacts is just about zero.  These are the precise three
qualifications we listed earlier for a Poisson process.

<p>We can change our perspective slightly and look at intervals in
<i>space</i> instead of in <i>time</i>.  Suppose we lay a grid upon a
map of London, dividing the city into squares.  We can then count the
number of V-2 landings in each square.  Some sections will have no
impacts (the lucky ones), while others will have one or more.
Thinking carefully about the Nazi's inaccurate guidance system, you
will recognize that a rocket landing in one square doesn't make it
either more or less likely that another rocket will land in the same
square later.  Put another way, the presence of one "dot" in a square
doesn't affect the likelihood you'll find another "dot" beside it in
the same space.  Poisson statistics let us calculate how many squares
we expect to have one "bombie", how many we can expect to have two or
more, and how many we can reasonably say will have none at all.  Of
course, we <i>can't</i> say which parts of the city will remain safe;
remember, the rockets land randomly.

<p>Learning statistics in a British classroom after World War II must
have been an interesting experience.

<p>Both the V-2 and the Poissonian description of its destructive
behavior became central themes in <a
