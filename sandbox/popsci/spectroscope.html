  <h2>Spectroscopy</h2>

  <h3>Revolution in Astronomy</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p><q>To attain a true idea of the nature and composition of this
    science <span class= "notquote">[astronomy]</span>, it is
    indispensable...to mark the boundaries of the positive knowledge
    that we are able to gain of the stars....We can never by any means
    investigate their chemical composition.</q></p>

    <p>Auguste Comte, <i>Cours de philosophie positive (1842)</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Philosophy students may call Auguste Comte (1798-1857) a great
  thinker, yet astronomers frequently remember him for the prediction
  he got wrong. Had Comte lived two years longer, he would have
  witnessed the discovery which revealed the ingredients of which
  stars are made.</p>

  <h3>Wave Nature of Light</h3>

  <p>For most of human history, all the information we had about stars
  we learned from their light. To a modern physicist, "light" covers a
  broad category: there is of course the "visible spectrum", which
  covers the colors we are used to seeing, but this is only one part
  of a much wider range. All this radiation, including visible light,
  consists of oscillations in a slightly mysterious medium called the
  <i>electromagnetic field</i>. For our purposes, the field's exact
  properties aren't too important; the critical point is that it can
  vibrate in various ways, much like the way ripples travel over a
  smooth lake.  The "wiggles" in this field all travel at the same
  speed, roughly 300,000 kilometres (186,000 miles) per
  second. Although the speed of all "electromagnetic waves" is the
  same, the waves can have different
  <i>wavelengths</i>: the distance from peak to peak can vary. The
  shortest wavelengths, belonging to the light we call <i>gamma
  rays</i>, can be less than one ten-billionth of a metre. Radio
  waves, on the other hand, are light with wavelengths that can be
  tens, hundreds or thousands of metres long.</p>

  <p>If we restrict our attention to the kind of light that human eyes
  can easily see, we find that red has the longest wavelength (about
  700 nanometres, where a nanometre is one billionth of a
  metre). Violet has the shortest wavelength, around 400
  nanometres. In between are all the familiar colors, the "ROY G BIV"
  we all learnt in elementary school. Light whose wavelength is just
  slightly longer than red is termed infrared, while light whose
  wavelength is shorter than violet is called ultraviolet. The cells
  in our eyes which receive light <i>are</i> weakly sensitive both to
  ultraviolet and infrared. Wearing goggles made from material that
  blocks all light except infrared lets the wearer observe the
  infrared radiation that one normally doesn't notice. The cornea, a
  transparent surface at the front of the eye, screens out ultraviolet
  (which would otherwise be harmful to the eye's interior). Patients
  who have had corneas removed sometimes report odd glows, coming from
  objects like newly washed white socks. (Laundry detergents often
  include ingredients that glow in visible light when exposed to
  ultraviolet, a phenomenon called
  <i>fluorescence</i>. This makes clothes appear "whiter than white", but has unintended consequences when
  people can actually <i>see</i> ultraviolet.)</p>

    <p>Roy G. Biv, Spectrum Extraordinaire</p>
  </div>

  <p>"White light" is actually a mixture of all the ROY G BIV
  colors. If one color is more predominant--if the mix has a stronger
  dose of light in one particular range of wavelengths--then the white
  light is tinged a certain hue. For example, the Sun shines
  yellowish. This concept of light is an old one: in the thirteenth
  century, Theodoric of Freiburg proposed a theory of the rainbow,
  according to which rain left tiny droplets of water in the air that
  bent light. Water bent different colors of light to different
  degrees, producing the separation we see. The great English
  scientist Isaac Newton was the first to make the idea explicit,
  however, by shining sunlight through a glass prism and observing the
  resulting separation.</p>

  <h2>Chemical Signatures</h2>

  <p>We can learn a surprising amount about starlight by watching what
  happens with everyday fire. This is a trifle odd, because the
  nuclear reactions which drive stars are far more powerful than the
  chemical reactions which produce ordinary fire. (The Sun would have
  gone dark after a few thousand years if it relied upon even the most
  efficient chemical fuel, yet all evidence indicates that it has
  shone steadily for a timespan a millionfold longer.) However, nature
  is often remarkable in how it presents the solution to distant
  puzzles in phenomena we find close at hand. Therefore, on we go:</p>

  <p>To start with, what affects the color of fire? In other words,
  what is responsible for making more light of one wavelength than of
  another? First of all, we note that flames from different sources
  have radically different appearances. The flame from a gas burner on
  a stove is bluish and not terribly illuminating, while wood burning
  in a fireplace or campfire is a dancing mix of reds, yellows and
  oranges. Observing more closely, we might catch a blue glow near the
  base of the campfire flame, near the burning wood.  Furthermore, if
  we let the fire die out, we might see bark on the fuel logs turn
  from orange-yellow to a dull cherry red, before becoming cold and
  black. Perhaps a red glow indicates a lower temperature than orange
  or yellow, and a blue flame indicates hotter burning still.</p>

  <p>This turns out to be the case, although explaining <i>why</i>
  stumped scientists for an awfully long time. In 1860, the German
  physicist <a href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kirchhoff.html">Gustav
  Robert Kirchhoff</a> (1824-1887) suggested studying solid black
  objects, which absorb all colors of light equally well. Kirchoff had
  noticed that objects tended to absorb certain colors while cool and
  emit those same colors when heated, so a black body--which absorbed
  all colors equally well--should radiate light of all
  wavelengths. Deciding
  <i>how much</i> of each wavelength light the black body would emit--in other words, which color would
  predominate in its "emission spectrum"--was a more difficult problem.</p>

  <div class="figure_left" style="width: 167px">
    <img src="kelvin-photograph.jpg" width="167" height="226"
    alt="Lord Kelvin" />

    <p><a href="http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/15/12/6">William
    Thompson,</a> Lord Kelvin (photograph courtesy <a
    href="http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/scientific-identity/CF/display_results.cfm?alpha_sort=k">Dibner
    Library, Smithsonian</a>)</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Austrian physicist Josef Stefan (1835-1893) studied a wide
  variety of substances heated to many temperatures, and in 1879 he
  announced that the <i>total</i> amount of radiation a body emitted
  depended upon the fourth power of its "absolute temperature". By
  this point, scientists had already deduced that heat was the jittery
  motion of molecules, and that the minimum possible
  temperature--<i>absolute zero</i>--must be when all molecular motion
  ceased. The British physicist William Thomson (1824-1907), who
  inherited the title Lord Kelvin, proposed a temperature scale based
  on this fact. Each degree would be the same size as a Celsius degree
  (1.8 Fahrenheit degrees), but the zero point would be at absolute
  zero, the coldest anything in the Universe could ever be. (Later,
  the German physical chemist William Nernst (1864-1941) reasoned that
  indicated absolute zero could never be reached, a conclusion called
  the "Third Law of Thermodynamics".) Lord Kelvin reckoned that 0
  degrees Celsius, the freezing point of water, was about 273 degrees
  above absolute zero. Later scientists made the figure more precise
  and named the scale in Kelvin's honor, so that one can say the
  freezing point of water is 273.15 kelvins. (Officially, the phrase
  "degrees Kelvin" is no longer used, and we simply say "kelvins"
  instead.)</p>

  <p>So, according to Stefan, if an object radiates a certain amount
  of light at 1,000 kelvins, if we double the temperature to 2,000
  kelvins, the object will radiate 2<sup>4</sup> = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16
  times as much.  If we <i>tripled</i> the temperature to 3,000
  kelvins, the total radiation output would increase by 3<sup>4</sup>
  = 81 times.</p>

  <p>This observation is nowadays called the <i>Stefan</i> or
  <i>Stefan-Boltzmann Law</i>. Using this rule and careful
  observations of the Sun's energy output, Stefan deduced that its
  surface temperature was around 5,700 K. At that temperature, Earthly
  objects also radiate yellowish-white light. (Lightning bolts give
  off flashes of purer white, which might suggest that they are hotter
  than the Sun's surface. This turns out to be the case: lightning
  bolts have been recorded five times hotter than the solar
  surface--but the temperature inside the Sun's core is much hotter
  still.)</p>

  <p>The next task was to figure out why some wavelengths are emitted
  more predominantly than others, and why this changes with
  temperature. Throughout the latter decades of the nineteenth
  century, physicists struggled to devise an equation that would
  predict how a hot ember glows orange, then turning red as it
  cools. In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) found an
  equation which reproduced the experimental observations that had
  been made of blackbody radiation. He then set about trying to find a
  way to deduce his equation from first principles. Like others before
  him, he found that this was impossible, according to the way light
  was then understood. He found that he was only able to reproduce the
  observed result if he assumed that the radiating blackbody gave off
  light in little pieces, instead of continuously, and that the energy
  of each discrete piece was inversely proportional to the
  wavelength. For example, violet light has roughly half the
  wavelength of red light, so a "lump" of violet light would carry
  twice as much energy as a "lump" of red light. Planck called these
  energy units <i>quanta</i>, from a Latin word meaning "how much?"
  (the singular is <i>quantum</i>, which became the adjective to
  describe Planck's theory).</p>

  <p>Planck suspected that quanta might merely be a mathematical trick
  for solving this one particular problem, but five years later,
  Albert Einstein (1879-1955) used the idea of quanta to explain how
  some metals can eject electrons when exposed to light. This
  phenomenon, the <i>photoelectric effect,</i> had likewise eluded
  earlier attempts at explanation, until Einstein resolved it. Because
  the photoelectric effect had nothing to do with blackbody radiation,
  it suddenly appeared that light really <i>was</i> made up of quanta,
  and that they were not a mere trick good for only solving one
  problem. (In fact, according to Einstein's Special Theory of
  Relativity, which he published in the same year, if you assume that
  light comes in quanta, the energy of each quantum <i>has to be</i>
  inversely proportional to the wavelength, just as Planck had
  originally imagined.)</p>

  <p>Thanks to Planck, if we observe an object to radiate a certain
  color, we can deduce its temperature, if it is a reasonably close
  match to the idealized blackbody. However, not all light sources
  fall into that category. Let us return to the campfire and observe
  another effect: if we throw a candy wrapper or a wadded-up magazine
  page onto the fire, it may flare a bright green before crumpling up
  into a heap of ashes. Surely, the magazine paper is burning at about
  the same temperature as newsprint, so why the difference?</p>

  <p>Suspicion falls on the <i>chemical</i> distinctions. Magazine
  paper is made with fillers to make it glossy, and it is often
  covered with various inks. Perhaps the ink reacts to heat in a way
  that gives off light wavelengths different from Planck's blackbody
  spectrum?</p>

  <p>Clearly, the thing to do is to test chemical substances for the
  flame colors they produce. In the mid-nineteenth century, the German
  chemist <a href=
  "http://step.sdsc.edu/projects95/chem.in.history/essays/bunsen.html">Robert
  Bunsen</a> invented a new type of burner specially adapted to this
  purpose. Gas made by cooking coal flowed up a pipe and out a nozzle,
  where it was ignited. Normally, the gas burned blue, just like a gas
  stove's flames, but Bunsen found that mixing air with the gas before
  burning it produced a colorless, non-luminous flame. Therefore,
  anything placed within the flame and ignited would only display its
  own colors, not those affected by the flame itself.</p>

  <p>Gustav Kirchhoff, who proposed the study of blackbody radiation,
  made use of Bunsen's burner. In 1859, he announed that all the
  chemical elements he had studied each produced a distinct spectrum,
  which he could identify by passing the flame's light through a
  prism. The prism spread out the light, but instead of seeing a
  continuous rainbow, Kirchhoff observed a pattern of distinct
  lines. The pattern of lines was different for each element, and
  what's more, Kirchhoff saw that when light passed through a vapor of
  some element, the element absorbed the same colors as it emitted
  when it was heated. (This led to his interest in the blackbody
  spectrum.)</p>

  <div class="spectrum">
    <img src="spec1.jpg" width="478" height="67" alt="Spectrum Lines" />

    <p>Something like what Kirchhoff saw? The spectrum lines are light
    emitted</p> 
  </div>

  <p>Kirchhoff realized that if a new rock sample were heated and its
  spectrum found to contain lines not characteristic of any known
  element, the sample must contain a <i>new</i> element, hitherto
  unknown. Using this technique, he discovered cesium a year later, in
  1860. He named it after a Latin word meaning "sky blue", because a
  spectral line of that color gave away the new element's existence. A
  year after that, he discovered the element rubidium, which he named
  for the Latin word meaning "red".</p>

  <p>Familiar with spectral analysis, Kirchhoff also pointed out that
  dark lines visible in the Sun's spectrum must be from elements in
  the solar atmosphere. He reasoned that gases in the Sun's atmosphere
  must be cooler than those on the surface or deep inside, so that
  their atoms would absorb their characteristic wavelengths and make
  dark lines across an otherwise continuous spectrum. Using this
  technique, Kirchhoff detected the presence of hydrogen, sodium and
  several other elements.</p>

  <div class="spectrum">
    <img src="spec2.jpg" width="463" height="71" alt="Absorption Lines in a Spectrum" />

    <p>Now, the spectrum lines are light absorbed. This and the above image illustrate the difference between
    "emission" spectra and "abosrption" spectra; spectroscopy is quite the versatile thing.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In 1868, the French astronomer Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen
  (1824-1907) took advantage of a total eclipse to study the spectra
  of solar prominences, eruptions in the Sun's surface which are
  normally only visible when the main part of the solar disc is
  blocked from view. (Otherwise, they are lost in the Sun's overall
  brightness.) Janssen detected a spectral line which did not match
  any known element. The British astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyear
  (1836-1920), who also worked on solar spectra, decided that this
  line must represent a new element. The new element, named
  <i>helium</i> from the Greek word for "sun", was the first one
  discovered off the Earth before it was observed on our own
  planet. (In later years, other unidentifiable lines have been
  observed in various celestial sources, but they have turned out to
  emanate from known elements in unusual conditions. Helium remains
  unique in this respect.)</p>

  <p>Helium remained unknown on Earth until 1895, when the British
  physicist John William Strutt, Lord Ramsay (1842-1919), discovered
  trace amounts of it inside a sample of clevite, a uranium
  ore. Several more years passed before the helium's presence was
  explained; the source turned out to be radioactive decay.</p>

  <h3>Doppler Shifts</h3>

  <p>Spectral lines are useful for more than identifying
  elements. When a source of waves moves relative to your position,
  the frequency of waves you receive changes. This phenomenon was
  first explained by the Austrian physicist and mathematician <a href=
  "http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Doppler.html">Christian
  Doppler</a> (1803-1853), and it is therefore known as the Doppler
  Effect. The classic example is a train whistle: as the train
  approaches, you can hear its whistle rise in pitch. The sound's
  pitch falls again as the train recedes into the distance. The pitch
  of a sound is the sound wave's frequency, just like a light wave's
  frequency gives its color. The Doppler Effect applies to light as
  well, although because the speed of light is almost nine hundred
  thousand times greater than that of sound, the frequency shift is
  harder to notice. Stars and galaxies often move with sufficient
  speed that the Doppler shift is noticeable, and the Doppler Effect
  is therefore a valuable measurement tool.</p>

  <div class="figure_left" style="width: 374px">
    <img src="doppler.jpg" width="374" height="236" alt="spectral lines Doppler shifting" />

    <p>Doppler shifting (from the <a
  href="http://www.psi.edu/esp/method.html">Extra-Solar Planet
  Search</a>)</p> </div>

  <p>You might notice a problem with using the Doppler Effect. If a
  star shines white light, which contains all colors and thus all
  frequencies, how can we detect a shift? Won't the ultraviolet
  frequencies just beyond the visible range be shifted into the
  violet, and the red frequencies into the infrared, leaving nothing
  to be observed? Not quite. First, recall that a "black body"
  radiates more light at some frequencies (<i>i.e.,</i> colors) than
  at others. The "frequency distribution" will peak at a particular
  place, which (as Kirchhoff observed) depends upon the
  temperature. The Doppler Effect shifts this peak towards the red or
  the blue end of the spectrum, "sliding" the frequency graph one way
  or the other. It turns out that a Doppler-shifted blackbody spectrum
  from a body at one temperature doesn't look exactly like a blackbody
  spectrum produced at any other temperature, so the shift can still
  be detected. A second way to notice the Doppler shift is the
  following: spectral lines, remember, cross the frequency band at
  definite places, depending upon the star's chemical composition. If
  we find the familiar lines for hydrogen, say, in an unexpected part
  of the spectrum, we can reasonably say that the star was moving
  relative to us and therefore had its light Doppler-shifted to new
  frequencies. By measuring the displacement between the lines of
  stationary hydrogen and those of the moving star, we can work out
  how the star is moving through space.</p>

  <p>The astronomer <a
  href="http://phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Schmidt/">Maarten
  Schmidt</a> (1929- ) working at Caltech in Pasadena, California,
  applied this method to strange objects astronomers had been unable
  to explain. Radio astronomers, using large antennae to receive
  signals, had detected unexpectedly strong radio sources in deep
  space. Because these objects looked like small, starlike points of
  light, they were termed "quasi-stellar radio sources". This mouthful
  was soon contracted to the short word <i>quasar</i>. Quasars showed
  spectral lines in the visible light region which no one could
  identify.  Schmidt realized that these peculiar lines were in fact
  typical ones for heated hydrogen normally observed in the
  <i>ultraviolet</i> range. In order for these UV lines to appear
  where they were, deep in the visible, the quasars' light would have
  to have been red-shifted to a fantastic degree. This in turn implied
  that the quasars were moving away from Earth at an incredible speed,
  a considerable fraction of the speed of light. We now know that
  quasars are billions of light-years distant from our home
  galaxy. Because it takes light billions of years to travel that
  distance, we see quasars <i>now</i> as they
  <i>were</i> in the distant past; they are among the earliest objects
  we can find in the Universe. For their light not to have faded
  entirely as it traveled one hundred billion trillion kilometres to
  reach us, quasars must have been extraordinarily bright. The source
  of their energy still puzzles astronomers and physicists. We would
  not have had this mystery to solve, however, without a careful study
  of their spectral lines.</p>
