<p>Revolution in Astronomy

<blockquote>
    <p><i>To attain a true idea of the nature and composition of this
    science </i>[astronomy]<i>, it is indispensable...to mark
    the boundaries of the positive knowledge that we are able to
    gain of the stars....We can never by any means investigate
    their chemical composition.</i> 
    <p>Auguste Comte, <i>Cours de philosophie positive</i> (1842)
</blockquote>

Philosophy students may call Auguste Comte (1798-1857) a great
thinker, yet astronomers frequently remember him for the prediction he
got wrong.  Had Comte lived two years longer, he would have witnessed
the discovery which revealed the ingredients of which stars are made.

<p><b>Wave Nature of Light</b>

<p>
For most of human history, all the information we had about stars we
learned from their light.  To a modern physicist, "light" covers a
broad category:  there is of course the "visible spectrum", which
covers the colors we are used to seeing, but this is only one part of
a much wider range.  All this radiation, including visible light,
consists of oscillations in a slightly mysterious medium called the
<i>electromagnetic field</i>.  For our purposes, the field's exact
properties aren't too important; the critical point is that it can
vibrate in various ways, much like the way ripples travel over a
smooth lake.  The "wiggles" in this field all travel at the same
speed, roughly 300,000 kilometres (186,000 miles) per second.
Although the speed of all "electromagnetic waves" is the same, the
waves can have different <i>wavelengths</i>:  the distance from peak
to peak can vary.  The shortest wavelengths, belonging to the light we
call <i>gamma rays</i>, can be less than one ten-billionth of a
metre.  Radio waves, on the other hand, are light with wavelengths
that can be tens, hundreds or thousands of metres long.

<p>If we restrict our attention to the kind of light that human eyes can
easily see, we find that red has the longest wavelength (about 700
nanometres, where a nanometre is one billionth of a metre).  Violet
has the shortest wavelength, around 400 nanometres.  In between are
all the familiar colors, the "ROY G BIV" we all learnt in elementary
school.  Light whose wavelength is just slightly longer than red is
termed infrared, while light whose wavelength is shorter than violet
is called ultraviolet.  The cells in our eyes which receive light
<i>are</i> weakly sensitive both to ultraviolet and infrared.  Wearing
goggles made from material that blocks all light except infrared lets
the wearer observe the infrared radiation that one normally doesn't
notice.  The cornea, a transparent surface at the front of the eye,
screens out ultraviolet (which would otherwise be harmful to the eye's
interior).  Patients who have had corneas removed sometimes report odd
glows, coming from objects like newly washed white socks.  (Laundry
detergents often include ingredients that glow in visible light when
exposed to ultraviolet, a phenomenon called <i>fluorescence</i>.  This
makes clothes appear "whiter than white", but has unintended
consequences when people can actually <i>see</i> ultraviolet.)

<p>"White light" is actually a mixture of all the ROY G BIV colors.  If
one color is more predominant--if the mix has a stronger dose of light
in one particular range of wavelengths--then the white light is tinged
a certain hue.  For example, the Sun shines yellowish.  This concept
of light is an old one: in the thirteenth century, Theodoric of
Freiburg proposed a theory of the rainbow, according to which rain
left tiny droplets of water in the air that bent light.  Water bent
different colors of light to different degrees, producing the
separation we see.  The great English scientist Isaac Newton was the
first to make the idea explicit, however, by shining sunlight through
a glass prism and observing the resulting separation.

<p><b>Chemical Signatures</b>

<p>We can learn a surprising amount about starlight by watching what
happens with everyday fire.  This is a trifle odd, because the nuclear
reactions which drive stars are far more powerful than the chemical
reactions which produce ordinary fire.  (The Sun would have gone dark
after a few thousand years if it relied upon even the most efficient
chemical fuel, yet all evidence indicates that it has shone steadily
for a timespan a millionfold longer.)  However, nature is often
remarkable in how it presents the solution to distant puzzles in
phenomena we find close at hand.  Therefore, on we go:

<p>To start with, what affects the color of fire?  In other words, what
is responsible for making more light of one wavelength than of
another?  First of all, we note that flames from different sources
have radically different appearances.  The flame from a gas burner on
a stove is bluish and not terribly illuminating, while wood burning in
a fireplace or campfire is a dancing mix of reds, yellows and
oranges.  Observing more closely, we might catch a blue glow near the
base of the campfire flame, near the burning wood.  Furthermore, if we
let the fire die out, we might see bark on the fuel logs turn from
orange-yellow to a dull cherry red, before becoming cold and black.
Perhaps a red glow indicates a lower temperature than orange or
yellow, and a blue flame indicates hotter burning still.

<p>This turns out to be the case, although explaining <i>why</i> stumped
scientists for an awfully long time.  In 1860, the German physicist <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kirchhoff.html">
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff</a> (1824-1887) suggested studying solid black
objects, which absorb all colors of light equally well.  Kirchoff had
noticed that objects tended to absorb certain colors while cool and
emit those same colors when heated, so a black body--which absorbed
all colors equally well--should radiate light of all wavelengths.
Deciding <i>how much</i> of each wavelength light the black body would
emit--in other words, which color would predominate in its "emission
spectrum"--was a more difficult problem.

<p>The Austrian physicist Josef Stefan (1835-1893) studied a wide variety
of substances heated to many temperatures, and in 1879 he announced
that the <i>total</i> amount of radiation a body emitted depended upon
the fourth power of its "absolute temperature".  By this point,
scientists had already deduced that heat was the jittery motion of
molecules, and that the minimum possible temperature--<i>absolute
zero</i>--must be when all molecular motion ceased.  The British
physicist William Thomson (1824-1907), who inherited the title Lord
Kelvin, proposed a temperature scale based on this fact.  Each degree
would be the same size as a Celsius degree (1.8 Fahrenheit degrees),
but the zero point would be at absolute zero, the coldest anything in
the Universe could ever be.  (Later, the German physical chemist
William Nernst (1864-1941) reasoned that indicated absolute zero could
never be reached, a conclusion called the "Third Law of
Thermodynamics".)  Lord Kelvin reckoned that 0 degrees Celsius, the
freezing point of water, was about 273 degrees above absolute zero.
Later scientists made the figure more precise and named the scale in
Kelvin's honor, so that one can say the freezing point of water is
273.15 kelvins.  (Officially, the phrase "degrees Kelvin" is no longer
used, and we simply say "kelvins" instead.)

<p>So, according to Stefan, if an object radiates a certain amount of
light at 1,000 kelvins, if we double the temperature to 2,000 kelvins,
the object will radiate 2<sup>4</sup> = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 times as
much.  If we <i>tripled</i> the temperature to 3,000 kelvins, the
total radiation output would increase by 3<sup>4</sup> = 81 times.

<p>This observation is nowadays called the <i>Stefan</i> or
<i>Stefan-Boltzmann Law</i>.  Using this rule and careful observations
of the Sun's energy output, Stefan deduced that its surface
temperature was around 5,700 K.  At that temperature, Earthly objects
also radiate yellowish-white light.  (Lightning bolts give off flashes
of purer white, which might suggest that they are hotter than the
Sun's surface.  This turns out to be the case: lightning bolts have
been recorded five times hotter than the solar surface--but the
temperature inside the Sun's core is much hotter still.)

<p>The next task was to figure out why some wavelengths are emitted more
predominantly than others, and why this changes with temperature.
Throughout the latter decades of the nineteenth century, physicists
struggled to devise an equation that would predict how a hot ember
glows orange, then turning red as it cools.  In 1900, the German
physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) found an equation which reproduced
the experimental observations that had been made of blackbody
radiation.  He then set about trying to find a way to deduce his
equation from first principles.  Like others before him, he found that
this was impossible, according to the way light was then understood.
He found that he was only able to reproduce the observed result if he
assumed that the radiating blackbody gave off light in little pieces,
instead of continuously, and that the energy of each discrete piece
was inversely proportional to the wavelength.  For example, violet
light has roughly half the wavelength of red light, so a "lump" of
violet light would carry twice as much energy as a "lump" of red
light.  Planck called these energy units <i>quanta</i>, from a Latin
word meaning "how much?" (the singular is <i>quantum</i>, which became
the adjective to describe Planck's theory).

<p>Planck suspected that quanta might merely be a mathematical trick for
solving this one particular problem, but five years later, Albert
Einstein (1879-1955) used the idea of quanta to explain how some
metals can eject electrons when exposed to light.  This phenomenon,
the <i>photoelectric effect,</i> had likewise eluded earlier attempts
at explanation, until Einstein resolved it.  Because the photoelectric
effect had nothing to do with blackbody radiation, it suddenly
appeared that light really <i>was</i> made up of quanta, and that they
were not a mere trick good for only solving one problem.  (In fact,
according to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, which he
published in the same year, if you assume that light comes in quanta,
the energy of each quantum <i>has to be</i> inversely proportional to
the wavelength, just as Planck had originally imagined.)

<p>Thanks to Planck, if we observe an object to radiate a certain color,
we can deduce its temperature, if it is a reasonably close match to
the idealized blackbody.  However, not all light sources fall into
that category.  Let us return to the campfire and observe another
effect:  if we throw a candy wrapper or a wadded-up magazine page onto
the fire, it may flare a bright green before crumpling up into a heap
of ashes.  Surely, the magazine paper is burning at about the same
temperature as newsprint, so why the difference?

<p>Suspicion falls on the <i>chemical</i> distinctions.  Magazine paper
is made with fillers to make it glossy, and it is often covered with
various inks.  Perhaps the ink reacts to heat in a way that gives off
light wavelengths different from Planck's blackbody spectrum?

<p>Clearly, the thing to do is to test chemical substances for the flame
colors they produce.  In the mid-nineteenth century, the German
chemist <a
href="http://step.sdsc.edu/projects95/chem.in.history/essays/bunsen.html">
Robert Bunsen</a> invented a new type of burner specially adapted to
this purpose.  Gas made by cooking coal flowed up a pipe and out a
nozzle, where it was ignited.  Normally, the gas burned blue, just
like a gas stove's flames, but Bunsen found that mixing air with the
gas before burning it produced a colorless, non-luminous flame.
Therefore, anything placed within the flame and ignited would only
display its own colors, not those affected by the flame itself.

<p>Gustav Kirchhoff, who proposed the study of blackbody radiation, made
use of Bunsen's burner.  In 1859, he announed that all the chemical
elements he had studied each produced a distinct spectrum, which he
could identify by passing the flame's light through a prism.  The
prism spread out the light, but instead of seeing a continuous
rainbow, Kirchhoff observed a pattern of distinct lines.  The pattern
of lines was different for each element, and what's more, Kirchhoff
saw that when light passed through a vapor of some element, the
element absorbed the same colors as it emitted when it was heated.
(This led to his interest in the blackbody spectrum.)

<p>Kirchhoff realized that if a new rock sample were heated and its
spectrum found to contain lines not characteristic of any known
element, the sample must contain a <i>new</i> element, hitherto
unknown.  Using this technique, he discovered cesium a year later, in
1860.  He named it after a Latin word meaning "sky blue", because a
spectral line of that color gave away the new element's existence.  A
year after that, he discovered the element rubidium, which he named
for the Latin word meaning "red".

<p>Familiar with spectral analysis, Kirchhoff also pointed out that dark
lines visible in the Sun's spectrum must be from elements in the solar
atmosphere.  He reasoned that gases in the Sun's atmosphere must be
cooler than those on the surface or deep inside, so that their atoms
would absorb their characteristic wavelengths and make dark lines
across an otherwise continuous spectrum.  Using this technique,
Kirchhoff detected the presence of hydrogen, sodium and several other
elements.

<p>In 1868, the French astronomer Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen (1824-1907)
took advantage of a total eclipse to study the spectra of solar
prominences, eruptions in the Sun's surface which are normally only
visible when the main part of the solar disc is blocked from view.
(Otherwise, they are lost in the Sun's overall brightness.)  Janssen
detected a spectral line which did not match any known element.  The
British astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyear (1836-1920), who also worked
on solar spectra, decided that this line must represent a new
element.  The new element, named <i>helium</i> from the Greek word for
"sun", was the first one discovered off the Earth before it was
observed on our own planet.  (In later years, other unidentifiable
lines have been observed in various celestial sources, but they have
turned out to emanate from known elements in unusual conditions.
Helium remains unique in this respect.)

<p>Helium remained unknown on Earth until 1895, when the British
physicist John William Strutt, Lord Ramsay (1842-1919), discovered
trace amounts of it inside a sample of clevite, a uranium ore.
Several more years passed before the helium's presence was explained;
the source turned out to be radioactive decay.

<p><b>Doppler Shifts</b>

<p>Spectral lines are useful for more than identifying elements.  When
a source of waves moves relative to your position, the frequency of
waves you receive changes.  This phenomenon was first explained by the
Austrian physicist and mathematician <a
href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Doppler.html">
Christian Doppler</a> (1803-1853), and it is therefore known as the
Doppler Effect.  The classic example is a train whistle: as the train
approaches, you can hear its whistle rise in pitch.  The sound's pitch
falls again as the train recedes into the distance.  The pitch of a
sound is the sound wave's frequency, just like a light wave's
frequency gives its color.  The Doppler Effect applies to light as
well, although because the speed of light is almost nine hundred
thousand times greater than that of sound, the frequency shift is
harder to notice.  Stars and galaxies often move with sufficient speed
that the Doppler shift is noticeable, and the Doppler Effect is
therefore a valuable measurement tool.

<p>You might notice a problem with using the Doppler Effect.  If a
star shines white light, which contains all colors and thus all
frequencies, how can we detect a shift?  Won't the ultraviolet
frequencies just beyond the visible range be shifted into the violet,
and the red frequencies into the infrared, leaving nothing to be
observed?  Not quite.  First, recall that a "black body" radiates more
light at some frequencies (<i>i.e.,</i> colors) than at others.  The
"frequency distribution" will peak at a particular place, which (as
Kirchhoff observed) depends upon the temperature.  The Doppler Effect
shifts this peak towards the red or the blue end of the spectrum,
"sliding" the frequency graph one way or the other.  It turns out that
a Doppler-shifted blackbody spectrum from a body at one temperature
doesn't look exactly like a blackbody spectrum produced at any other
temperature, so the shift can still be detected.

A second way to notice the Doppler shift is the following: spectral
lines, remember, cross the frequency band at definite places,
depending upon the star's chemical composition.  If we find the
familiar lines for hydrogen, say, in an unexpected part of the
spectrum, we can reasonably say that the star was moving relative to
us and therefore had its light Doppler-shifted to new frequencies.  By
measuring the displacement between the lines of stationary hydrogen
and those of the moving star, we can work out how the star is moving
through space.

<p>The astronomer <a
href="http://phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Schmidt/">Maarten
Schmidt
</a> (1929- ) working at Caltech in Pasadena, California, applied this
method to strange objects astronomers had been unable to explain.
Radio astronomers, using large antennae to receive signals, had
detected unexpectedly strong radio sources in deep space.  Because
these objects looked like small, starlike points of light, they were
termed "quasi-stellar radio sources".  This mouthful was soon
contracted to the short word <i>quasar</i>.  Quasars showed spectral
lines in the visible light region which no one could identify.
Schmidt realized that these peculiar lines were in fact typical ones
for heated hydrogen normally observed in the <i>ultraviolet</i>
range.  In order for these UV lines to appear where they were, deep in
the visible, the quasars' light would have to have been red-shifted to
a fantastic degree.  This in turn implied that the quasars were moving
away from Earth at an incredible speed, a considerable fraction of the
speed of light.  We now know that quasars are billions of light-years
distant from our home galaxy.  Because it takes light billions of
years to travel that distance, we see quasars <i>now</i> as they
<i>were</i> in the distant past; they are among the earliest objects
we can find in the Universe.  For their light not to have faded
entirely as it traveled one hundred billion trillion kilometres to
reach us, quasars must have been extraordinarily bright.  The source
of their energy still puzzles astronomers and physicists.  We would
not have had this mystery to solve, however, without a careful study
of their spectral lines.
