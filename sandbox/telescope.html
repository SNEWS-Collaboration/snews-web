<p align="center">Telescope Era</p>

<p>Kepler saw his supernova in the year 1604.  Four years later, an
eyeglass-maker living in Holland, Hans Lippershey (1570-1619), put two
lenses on the ends of a tube, making a device which made distant
objects look larger.  In 1609, Galileo Galilei built his own, improved
telescope, which he offered to the city leaders of Venice, saying it
could be used to spot ships at sea.  The Venetians, pleased that they
could see incoming merchant vessels two hours ahead of their
competition (and therefore get a jump on the market) gave Galileo a
considerable pay raise.  By the end of that year, however, Galileo had
shifted his attention to grander sights, aiming his instrument at the
sky.  He published his observations in the short book <i>Siderius
Nuncius</i>, Latin for <i>The Starry Messenger</i>.

Galileo's book blasted the old view of the Universe apart.  He
described spots of light he had seen moving around the planet
Jupiter.  The telescope made it clear that they were Jupiter's moons,
circling the planet the way Earth orbits the Sun and our Moon orbits
the Earth.  Furthermore, his telescope revealed that Venus goes
through phases just like the Moon does, sometimes showing a thin
crescent and at other times a complete disk.  Galileo concluded that
he was seeing the planet illuminated differently as it traveled around
the Sun, one more piece of evidence that Copernicus had been right and
Aristotle wrong.

Few people can have the opportunity Galileo had.  Anywhere he pointed
his telescope, he made a new discovery.  To balance this luck,
perhaps, Galileo's support of Copernicus landed him in trouble with
the Inquisition, and the Catholic Church eventually placed him under
house arrest.  Even more galling, though, is the thought of the
discovery he missed, by just a few short years.  Had Galileo owned his
telescope six years before, he could have observed Kepler's supernova,
the bright star of 1604.  He might not have spotted it sooner (with a
telescope, small areas of the sky look big, so picking the right place
to look can be a challenge), but he could have observed it long after
it was too dim for the naked eye to see.
