<P>Here is a brief description of the client/server code written by
Alec Habig, Kate Scholberg, and corrinne mills.  It is written in standard C.  
As usual, the best way to learn about it is to read the code (we hope
we've put in reasonable in-code documentation!), but reading this
overview first may be helpful.  A book by W. Richard Stevens, <i>Unix
Network Programming</i>, is strongly recommended to code developers.

<P>The coincidence code has client and server parts, to implement a
socket connection using a TCP protocol.  The server process,
<strong>gcserver</strong>, sits and waits for a connection.  The
client process establishes a connection with, and relays information to,
the server, and can be invoked by calling any of the routines 
<strong>gccli</strong>, <strong>gcpingcli</strong>, and i
<strong>gcretcli</strong>. <strong>gccli</strong> relays alarm information 
to the server when a supernova alarm condition is detected.  
<strong>gcpingcli</strong> checks the connection with the server.  
<strong>gcretcli</strong> tells the server to retract an alarm message 
previously sent.  Each routine can connect to more than one server. 

<h3>Programs</h3>
These four executables can be built from the Makefile built by gc_config.
<ul>
<li> <strong>gcserver</strong> is the server programs (see 
	<strong>server code</strong>). 
<li> <strong>testgcli</strong> is the fortran test client program.
<li> <strong>ctestgcli</strong> is the C test client program. <br>
	both test client programs can run each of the three client routines.
	See <strong>client code</strong> for more information.
<li> <strong>retract_util</strong> is a command line user interface 
	to the alarm retraction routine.
</ul>

<h3>Files</h3>

Both client and server files can be obtained and modified via cvs from
the <strong>coinccode</strong> module
in the snrep repository on kaboom; please see the cvs information <a
href=cvs_intro.html>here</a>. 
<P>
<ul>

<li> <strong>gcserver.c</strong>  is the server program.

<li> <strong>gccli.c</strong> contains the three client 
programs: <strong>gccli</strong> to send alarm packets, 
<strong>gcretcli</strong> to send retraction packets, and 
<strong>gcpingcli</strong> to send ping packets.  There is source for calling
each of these, from either Fortran or C, in <strong>gccli.c</strong>.

<li> <strong>testgcli.f</strong> is a test client program,
for calling gccli, gcretcli, or gcpingcli from a simple Fortran program.

<li> <strong>ctestgcli</strong> is a test client program in C.

<li> Both client and server will need to link against
  <strong>error, packets, open_sockets, gc_ssl</strong> and
<strong>timeconv</strong> objects;
in addition the server also needs to link against
<strong>alarmQueue</strong>.

<li> Compilation is currently handled with a Makefile generated from the 
<strong>Makefile.in</strong> included in the module, by the perl script 
<strong>gc_config</strong>, using the shell script <strong>configure</strong> 
which is generated from <strong>configure.in</strong> by autoconf.  
<strong>configure</strong> also requires the script 
<strong>config.guess</strong> in order to guess at the system type.
(these are included in the module since not all systems have autoconf)  See the
included <a href="https://cyclo.mit.edu/snnet/wg/coinccode/readme.html">README</a> 
for more information on configuring and building, which has gotten a 
bit more complicated with the addition of the ssl code as well as the 
change to a configure system instead of different Makefiles.  

<li> <strong>Include</strong> files can be found in the include subdirectory.

<li> <strong>retract_util.c</strong> is the source code for the 
	alarm retraction utility.

<li> a <a href="https://cyclo.mit.edu/snnet/wg/coinccode/readme.html">
README</a> containing some information on installation 
is now included in the module.

</ul>

<p> At present, we're dealing with differences between different
platforms using #ifdefs.  If you make a platform-dependent change to
the code, please use this convention.

<p> The test version is compiled by default.  The real version
needs extra compilation flags.

<h3> Setup in the snnet account on kaboom</h3> 

<p>On kaboom, a checked
out version of the code and compiled executables can be found in
/home/snnet/coinccode.  The running test version (and some other files that
go along with it) can be found in /home/snnet/gcalert.  Output goes to
/home/snnet/gcalert/gcalert.out (test junk output there only).

<p>Some useful files in this area: (not in the repository; you will
need to create versions of some of them in your test area if you are running
your own test server.)

<ul>
<li> <strong>good_addresses.dat:</strong> list of authorized IP
addresses.
<li> <strong>serv_ip_address.dat:</strong> the server IP address list.
The client will try to connect to all the servers in this list.
Modify to run a test server on your machine.
<li> <strong>gcserv:</strong> startup script.
<li> <strong>checkgc:</strong> script to check if server is running 
(run by cron on kaboom).
<li> <strong>send_alert.sh, send_info.sh:</strong> alert emailing scripts.
</ul>

<h3>Server Code</h3>

<strong>gcserver</strong> maintains a queue of alarms, kept in a
linked list data structure.  

<p>When an alarm is received, it decodes it
and checks that its time stamp is reasonable.  Next, it inserts the
alarm into the queue according the time stamp, cleans up the queue to
get rid of any old alarms, then searches the queue for a coincidence.
Before searching, it also writes alarms to disk, so that for the case
of a crash, it can retrieve the list of alarms at startup.  For the case
of a sufficiently high level coincidence, it runs the email scripts.

<p>When a retraction packet is received, it decodes it and checks that
the start time for retraction is before the end time.  Then, it retracts all
alarms from the specified experiment, within the time range given, inclusive.
(that means that if start time = end time, only the packet with 
start time = end time = time stamp will be retracted.  this allows
a client to retract only one, specific packet, or a range of them.) The 
revised queue is written to the disk, so that in case of a crash, the server
does not reread in the false alarms, and find a coincidence with them.  

<p> The main routine is in <strong>gcserver.c</strong>; socket
routines are in <strong>open_sockets.c</strong>; routines
for encoding and decoding packets are in <strong>packets.c</strong>;
time conversion utilites are in <strong>timeconv.c</strong>; alarm
queue routines are in <strong>alarmQueue.c</strong>, ssl routines are
in <strong>gc_ssl.c</strong>, and error routines are in 
<strong>cerror.c</strong> and <strong>serror.c</strong>.

<h3>Client Code</h3>
<strong>gccli</strong> currently takes 4 arguments:
<UL>
<LI> The UT time of the burst, in a 3-integer format:
DDMMYY,HHMMSS,nanosecond ticks.
<LI> The "level" of the burst;
possibly to indicate the typical Poissonian background
rate of the alarm, a shortword.
<LI> The "significance" of the burst; another
measure of the certainty of the alarm, possibly
the estimated distance to the supernova, a longword.
<LI> Experiment number (currently 1 for MACRO,
2 for Super-K, 3 for SNO, 5 for LVD; others will be assigned as
more experiments join), a shortword.

</UL>
The exact contents of "level" and "significance" have not yet
been decided; they can be left dummy for now (value of 1 for
"level", 0 for "significance").

<p><strong>gcretcli</strong> currently takes three arguments:
<UL>
<LI> The experiment number (same as in <strong>gccli</strong>) whose
alarm packets are to be retracted.
<LI> The earliest packets to be retracted, specified by their UT time stamp, in
a 3 integer format: DDMMYY, HHMMSS, nanosecond ticks.
<LI> The latest packets (by UT time stamp, same format) to retract.
</UL>

<strong>gcpingcli</strong> currently takes two arguments:
<UL>
<LI> The UT time of the ping (3-integer format like stated above).
<LI> The experiment number (same as in <strong>gccli</strong>) sending the 
ping packet.  
</UL>

<p>Each of these three routines returns an integer value: 0 for
successful send, -1 or the standard error number (errno), if it is defined,
for send failure.  <strong>Note that the return values have changed!</strong>

<h3> Suggested improvements </h3>

There are many minor (and major) improvements that could be made to
the code, to improve efficiency and elegance (not counting
bugs!). <a href=todo.html>Here</a> is a list.
