<P>CVS, or Concurrent Versions System, is an effective system allowing
multiple people to work on the same coding project.  It's widely
available and pretty standard.

<P>Here is an <a href=http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html>
online manual</a>. You can download the whole manual as postscript
<a href=http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs.ps>here</a>.

<h3> Setting things up </h3>

<p>On Unix systems, do

<pre>
setenv CVSROOT :ext:snrep@kaboom.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp:/home/snrep/repository
</pre>
This tells cvs where the repository lives.

<p> You will also need to do
<pre>
setenv CVS_RSH ssh
</pre>
to tell cvs to use secure shell for transmission (necessary to
kaboom),
and
<pre>
setenv CVS_SERVER "env LOGNAME=yourusername cvs"
</pre>
to tell cvs who you are for the purpose of making commits.


<h3> Checking out and committing</h3>

<p> Here's a very quick survey of the most common commands;
please consult the manual for more information.

<p> After you have cvs set up, you can "check out" a version
of the code from the repository to work on it.  The module
containing both server and client code is the 
<strong>coinccode</strong> module.

<pre>
cvs checkout coinccode
</pre> 
will create a version of the module in your working directory.

<p> After making a modification, to enter the change into the
repository ("commit" it), do

<pre>
cvs commit <filename>
</pre>

<p> To update the module to the most recent files in the repository, do

<pre>
cvs update
</pre>
in the directory to be updated.

<p>If you wish to be notified of commits to the repository, you can
get an automatically generated email message by checking out
the CVSROOT module, adding your email address to snrep.list and
committing.
