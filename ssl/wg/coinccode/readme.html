<h2> <center>coinccode README</center> </A></h2>
</Head>

<h3><p> this is (a slightly altered version of) the README file currently 
included with the coinccode module. <p></h3>

<hr>
<h4>the short version:</h4>
<ul>

	<li> install <a href="http://openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>.  you need 
	  the command line application, so 
	  make sure you get the full distribution even if you install 
	  a package with rpm.  run the default installation so that the 
	  config files can find needed files (& applications)
	
	<li> set these environment variables: 
	  RANDFILE : a file to read random info from. (i.e. /dev/random)

	<li> in the coinccode directory, run gc_config
	  (run gc_config --help for more information)
	  it'll build you a Makefile from Makefile.in using configure
	  and config.guess.

	<li> in the top-level openssl directory, run CA.sh -newreq,
	  giving either gcclient or gcserver as the common name,
          remember your password, and email me the certificate request.
  
	<li> when i email you back the signed request, decrypt it.
	  (if you don't do so, you will be prompted for your passphrase
	  every time gcserver is started or any of the client functions
	  is called. if you're trying to automate, this is probably bad).  
	  use 
	  	openssl rsa -in encrypted_key.pem -out decrypted_key.pem
	  you will be prompted for your passphrase, and the decrypted
	  version of your key will be written to the file given after
	  -out.  you need to recombine the files, substituting the decrypted
	  key in the out file for the encrypted key in the certificate file
	  (that is, replace one RSA PRIVATE KEY block for the other)
	  
	<li> you should be able to build and run gcserver, and call the gcclient
	  applications.  you should not have to change any code that 
	  calls the client routines -- externally, they look the same.
	  (actually, the client routines now return 0 for success and nonzero
	  for failure: this has changed!)

	<li> if this doesn't work, read the stuff below and/or email 
	  <a href="mailto:cmills@superk.bu.edu">  cmills@superk.bu.edu. </a>

<h4>the gory details </h4>
<hr>
<hr>

<p>
<h4>how gc_config looks for the OpenSSL include and library files </h4><br>

look at gc_config for the complete details but here's the gist:  if 
configure itself doesn't find the libraries and ssl.h, gc_config looks 
for them in a few places:
<ul>
	<li> first, it checks the default install location that 
	  'make install' for openssl puts them:
	  libssl.a, libcrypto.a --> /usr/local/ssl/lib
	  openssl/ssl.h (etc) --> /usr/local/ssl/include

	<li> then, it checks for the environment variable 
	  SSL_LIBS or SSL_INCLUDE (whichever is appropriate to what
	  it's looking for) to see if they are defined, and if so,
	  if the files it's looking for are in those directories.

	<li> finally, it sees if the command 'locate' exists on this
	  computer.  if so, it runs locate to find the file, and 
	  picks up the first directory returned by locate as containing
	  the file.

	<li> if none of these steps locates the file, gc_config exits
	  and advises the user that they should install openssl.
	  (or move it somewhere easier to find, or set an env)
	
	<li> in other words, here are ways to let gc_config find ssl:
	  	- install openssl (using the --prefix and
		  --openssldir options, see openssl's INSTALL
		  file for details) in a standard location, so that
		  configure can find it.
		- install openssl in its default location by simply
		  running make install
		- set SSL_LIBS to the directory containing libssl.a
		  and libcrypto.a, and set SSL_INCLUDE to the dir
		  containing openssl/ssl.h (that openssl/ contains
		  all of the other header files, too)
		- locate is kind of a last resort -- i wouldn't rely
		  on it, esp. since it's not installed on all machines.

</ul>

<hr>
<h4>random number generation</h4><br>
<ul>
	
	<li> you may well already have a "randomness device", and it'll just
	  be a matter of pointing ssl in the right direction.

	<li> set the environmental variable RANDFILE to a file that can 
	  be used to seed random number generation:  i.e.
	  /dev/random or /dev/urandom.

	<li> if you still get PRNG (PRNG = Pseudo Random Number Generator)
	  not seeded errors, try linking $HOME/.rnd to /dev/random with <br>
  	  	ln -s $RANDFILE $HOME/.rnd <br>
	  (this in particular may help with certificate and certificate
	  request generation. -- a lot of the ssl functions check that
	  location as well as or instead of $RANDFILE)

	<li> for solaris, you may need to get /dev/random, a random number seeder 
	  that uses information from the terminal (interrupts, mouse movements, 
	  keystrokes) to create a FIFO from which (nearly irreproducible) 
	  random bytes can be read*.  this can be found as a patch from sun, 
	  under patch id 105710-01.  

	<li> it may also be necessary to install an entropy gathering daemon, 
	  which operates similarly to /dev/random, or maybe in concert with it.
	  i don't know so much about it, since i haven't needed it,  but 
	  there's some stuff about it at openssl.org.  

	<li> the FAQ at openssl.org has more information on much of this.

	<li> you may need to adjust the constant SEED_BYTES in gc_ssl.h if 
	  the PRNG seeding takes forever.  you should not set it to less 
	  than 1024 -- i believe it will generate an error if you do so.  
	  (not to mention that it's just kind of a bad idea.)
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>you must have a __certificate__. </h4><br>
	
	<strong>generating a certificate</strong><br>
	
<ul>
	<li> to generate a certificate request, 
	  in your <openssl>/apps directory, run CA.sh -newreq. <p>

	<li> make sure that you give your certificate the common name
	  "gcclient" or "gcserver", exactly (all lower-case).  
	  this is one of the checks that the server uses (the client 
	  checks for a good common name, too) <p>

	<li> <strong>remember your password!</strong> <p>

	<li> email the request to 
	  <a href="mailto:cmills@superk.bu.edu">  cmills@superk.bu.edu. </a>
	  and i'll sign it and  email it back to you.  this is secure 
	  because the private key you generated (which is in both the request 
	  and the certificate) is protected by your password.
	  (the main check of authenticity is checking that it was signed by
	  the gcCA certifying authority i set up on superk) <p>

	<li> if you want to avoid having to reenter the pass phrase every time
	  gcserver runs or your program calls one of the client routines,
	  double check that the cert file is not readable by anyone other than
	  the account that the code runs in, and use
	  	openssl rsa -in encrypted_key.pem -out decrypted_key.pem
	  you will be prompted for your passphrase, and the decrypted
	  version of your key/cert file will be writtent to the file given after
	  -out. <p>

	__other notes__ <p>

	<li> "unable to write to 'random state'" error msg is ok:
	  that's just openssl's attempt to write back to the random 
	  file (/dev/random):
	  not critical, hence not a fatal err.  nothing to worry about. <p>

	<li> on superk: i setenv'd OPENSSL_CONFIG to $SSL_REFS/apps/openssl.cnf,
	  where SSL_REFS is /pdk2/scratch/habig/openssl-0.9.5beta2/ ,
	  and added -config $OPENSSL_CONFIG to CA.sh
	  another version of openssl.cnf, the default i think, is <where?>
	  ---the default is fine unless you're me, btw.   <p>

	<li> i have everything set up in our SSL_REFS directory on superk
	  so that we have a working CA of sorts.  all the stuff is in
	  gcCA/, and things are setup in OPENSSL_CONFIG and CA.sh such that
	  gcCA and not demoCA is the working certifying authority.   <p>

</ul>

<hr>
<h4>on configure, configure.in, Makefile.in, and gc_config:</h4><br>
<ul>
	<li> __easy: configure__<br>
	  to just use coinccode, just run ./gc_config, which will generate
	  Makefile from Makefile.in.  <p>

	<li> __editing Makefile (Makefile.in)__<br>
	  if you want to change something in Makefile, try to change it by 
	  editing Makefile.in.  everything not surrounded by @'s
	  (for example, @LIBS@) is copied verbatim into the Makefile.  <p>

	<li> __autoconf__<br>
	  if you've made major changes to the source code, (especially anything
	  that requires new header files or libraries), run 'autoscan' 
	  if you have it, and then diff configure.scan configure.in.  
	  if configure.scan has anything that configure.in doesn't, 
	  add it to configure.in.  then, run autoconf to regenerate configure
	  from configure.in.  or, better yet, run gc_config --autoconf and 
	  let gc_config take care of creating any required files.  <p>
  
	<li>  __gc_config__<br>
	  run gc_config --help for usage hints for gc_config.<br>
	  to quote the header comments on gc_config: <br>
	<ul>

		# this exists largely to clean up the use of autoconf<br>
		# and configure -- they were built to do a lot of things, <br>
		# and we just don't need much.  in particular, they require <br>
		# a number of files we don't necessarily want<br>
		# cluttering up our stuff -- files like NEWS, or scripts <br>
		# callable from configure, whose presence is required <br>
		# (install.sh, config.sub), but which can be completely blank.  <br>

		# the other reason for this script is that there is a <br>
		# standard location for openssl to install itself and <br>
		# its libraries, in which configure does not look.<br>
		# i'd rather not tinker around with configure itself, <br>
		# so that it is easy to regenerate (relatively speaking) <br>
		# from configure.in, so it made more sense to make a <br>
		# wrapper script.  <br>
	</ul>
	</ul>
		
<p>
* a note on this file:  since it is a FIFO, if you try to read from it looking
  for an EOF, that read will never return.  it's much better just to specify
  some max number of bytes to read, or something along that line.

<hr>
<h4>further stuff  </h4>
<p>
<h4>reading SSL error output:  </h4><br>
<ul>
	<li> the 2nd to last item is the name of the file that output the error.

	<li> the last item, a number, is the line number at which the error 
	  was called.

	<li> the third from last item is the name of the error.

	<li> the fourth from last item is the name of the function in which 
	  the error occurred.
</ul>

<h4> debugging: to get the ssl libraries to play nice with debuggers:</h4>
<ul>
	<li> ./config -d   may do all the work.  <br>
	  but<br>
	  it didn't on my machine.  <br>
	  <br>
	  other things to do:<p>

	<li> in Configure, edit the line for the appropriate platform*:
	<ul>
		<li> remove -fomit-frame-pointer (if using gcc)
		<li> remove any flags starting with -O
	</ul><p>
	<li> or, use ./Configure instead of ./config to configure.  then,
	  you can specify the platform and compiler to use.  i used this
	  to switch the compiler from the default option for my setup (cc) 
	  to gcc, by running <br>
			./Configure debug-solaris-sparcv9-gcc .<br>
	  switching this will enable gdb to read the line # info. <p>

	<li> for more information see: 
	<ul>
		<li> the INSTALL text file in the top level openssl directory
		<li> http://www2.psy.uq.edu.au/~ftp/Crypto/#Problems
	</ul>
		(i collated this information from those 2 sources,
		 with the help of much trial and error.  :>  )
<p>	 
<hr>
<p>

<li> to find out what platform you're running, run ./config -t  .  
  (note that config -t changes no files.) alternatively, do the default build, 
  and read after the PLATFORM= at the top of the Makefile on the 
  top level.  (mine, for example, says debug-solaris-sparcv9-gcc
  at the moment.)  <p>

  these lines start under the line "my %table=(".  each line is surrounded
  by quotes.  they run for quite a while.  (from line 91 to line 377 in mine.)
