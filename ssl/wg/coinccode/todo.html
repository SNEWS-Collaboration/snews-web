<p> A few things to do to increase robustness and elegance of the
code...  (for major jobs, look 
<a href="joblist.html">here</a>).

<ul>

<li> for some types of client failure, have an email sent to a maintainer
that something has gone amiss, since log files won't always be read.  
examples of email situation: packet rejected because of bad i.p. address
(perhaps the computer was switched), expired certificate (that'll happen) 
(about-to-expire certificate warnings may be even more useful).

<li> in gcserver.c, it would be nice to have the server notify the client 
somehow as to the status of the retraction request (that it was not handled
due to bad retract times, or to report on packets retracted.)

<li> in packets.c, have send_packet() deal intelligently with error codes.

<li> for retract_util: simplify it, and add "panic-button mode", which allows
instant retraction of all packets sent in the last 12 hours, 1 hour, or 1 
minute, etc.  

<li> in packets.c, implement bail_to_phone(), which uses a modem connection
as a backup to the current network connection.

<li> in gcserver.c, someone has expressed a desire to see a more sophisticated
assessment of alarm level.  (current dummy function alarm_level())

<li> in gc_ssl.c: have some checks of peer authenticity within the callback
functions, instead of the current dummy function.  the problem is that we 
cannot see our own certificate information within this callback function.
(i think).

<li> in gccli.c: have error messages be more specific about where the 
client failed: in SSL handshake, because they had the wrong I.P. address, etc.
The server could possibly also write to the client that they don't have
an acceptable address, since the connection is established.  

<li> in gccli.c: seeding the random number generator (by the call to 
RAND_load_file in gc_ssl.c) takes a while in some systems.  for the server, 
this is o.k., but for the client routines, it would be nice to have some 
way of seeding it once in the calling program, instead of every time the
routine is called.  with C, this wouldn't be *too* hard, although it would
make calls to the gc_client code less self-contained.  the main problem is that
you would need to hang on to C structures in the calling program -- it's 
messy in C, and, i believe, impossible in Fortran.  but if there's some clever
way to do this, it would be nice.  (refer to the code for RAND_load_file
in <openssl-source-top>/crypto/rand/randfile.c ).

<li> Robustness checks; make sure code can handle wacky datagram
field values; wide variety of stress-testing.  --> some stress testing has been
done, esp. for overloading the server with client requests.  this was done
after the switch to TCP but before the ssl code was added. (July 2000)

<li> More elegant emailing system.

<li> Fix day of week in time_t in timeconv.c

<li> Improve same-packet check.

<li> Lots more...

</ul>
