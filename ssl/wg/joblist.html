Here's a list of jobs that need doing for the coincidence code, ordered
roughly according to some linear combination of importance and ease of
implementation.  See the <a
href="http://hep.bu.edu/~schol/workshop/summary2.ps">
workshop summary</a> for additional notes.


<ul> 

<li><strong>Secure socket implementation:</strong> This is quite
important; we need to implement secure PGP-based connections for the
information passed by socket.  -> <font COLOR=\"\#FF0000\"> Done; August 
2000, email to working group soon. </font> openssl has been
integrated into the (now TCP instead of UDP) code; certificate authentication
has been added as well.

<p>some ssl information:

<UL>
<p><li><a href="http://www.openssl.org/">the main page of OpenSSL</a>
 has a faq, and limited documentation.
<li>i highly reccomend this
<a href="http://www2.psy.uq.edu.au/~ftp/Crypto/ssl.html#HDR0">
programmer's reference </a>
as a place to start.
<li><a href="http://www2.psy.uq.edu.au/~ftp/Crypto"> another faq. </a> 
  this one is an excellent introduction to OpenSSL in general.
<li> many of these have additional links on them i've found useful-- they're
worth poking around.  
<li> my <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cmills/openssl/">
	intro to openssl </a> page.  
</UL>

<p> <li> <strong> PGP signing of alarm
messages:</strong> The easiest fake is simply a simulated message to the
astronomer mailing list.  To avoid this, we ought to make sure that the
messages are PGP-signed, so that astronomers will know that they have
come from a legitimate source.  -> <font COLOR=\"\#FF0000\"> Done; see Alec's email in the archive.</font><P>

<li> <strong>Implementation of multiple servers:</strong> currently
things are set up for a single server.  The client sends its message to
a single place.  Ideally, we'd like to have each client attempt to send
a message to each of several servers.  This should be fairly
straightforward to implement: serv_ip_addr will contain a list of
servers, and send_packet can loop through the list sequentially ->
<font COLOR=\"\#FF0000\">Done, Dec 1999.</font> But we still need to think about how will we will
deal with multiple alarms from multiple servers.
<p>

<li> <strong> Alarm retraction utilities:</strong>
 A very useful thing would be for any individual experiment to retract
its alarm after determining it was a fake, i.e. removing it from the
queue, so that there will be no coincidence with a subsequent
(time-stamped) alarm from another experiment.  
 -> <font COLOR=\"\#FF0000\">Done, June 2000.
</font>  This is implemented with a third packet type, which tells the 
servers to retract packets from a given experiment, within a specified range of
time stamps.
<P>

<li><strong> Anti-coincidence check (ping for alive-or-dead) and timeout
</strong>  As was agreed on during the last meeting, it would be
valuable to use "anti-coincidence" information to reduce the rate
of bogus alarms, i.e. if there's a coincidence, all experiments
are queried as to their alive-or-dead status, and the coincidence
condition is modified to require a signal in all experiments 
(or some reasonable fraction of experiments) which
should have seen a signal.

<p>This will take some thought, and some work, to implement, since it
requires two-way communication; the client must become a server as well
and the server must act as client.  We have to decide how to do this.
Another complication is the fact that different experiments may take
different times to produce an alarm, so some kind of timeout has to be
implemented.

<p> <strong>Update--</strong> there is the beginnings of an anti-coincidence
server in anti_server.c and gccli.c(in the anti_client routine, which
would be called by gc_server).  there is an anti-coincidence check-type
packet in packets.h.  this is just the germ of the structure that we'd need --
a lot more needs to be done with this.  

<p>
<li><strong> Consistency check (events/kton)</strong>

This is essentially the same problem as the above, just some additional
information exchanged.
<p>

<li> <strong> Tests of timing, other tests: </strong> How can 
we tell if the individual clocks are in coincidence?  

<p>
<li> A number of minor jobs; look <a href="coinccode/todo.html">here</a>.

</ul>

Currently, this is being worked on by 
<a href="mailto:cmills@fas.harvard.edu">corrinne mills </a>.
my own working notes on potential code changes can be found in the 
code by grepping in the source code for the tag "note:" (colon incl.),
which i use to mark things i want to change/improve.
