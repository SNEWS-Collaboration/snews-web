Experiment Updates:
------------------

* LVD (W. Fulgione): everything smooth, active mass is 874 tons,
livetime has been 99% over the last years.  Alarms to SNEWS are
automated.  The alarm rate is very nicely Poissonian and they have
selected an alarm rate of 1/week. Sensitivity is well beyond the edge
of the Galaxy).  (Q: can alarm rate be lowered?  How much sensitivity
would be lost?)  They are planning a re-calibration program soon, but
since the detector is modular and calibrations can be done only on
part of the detector at any given time, it will not affect up-time.

* SNO (F. Fleurot): SNO NCD phase has begun.  Fabrice described the
SNO supernova watch (see also conference poster).  There are 3 levels
of selected bursts after automatic background reduction: level 2
bursts invoke email messages to the SNO supernova group, and level 3
bursts initiate phone and text messages.  They are currently studying
how to integrate both PMT and NCD information for supernova watch
background reduction.  They are also working on implementing high-rate
suppression (like that of SNEWS) internally at SNO.

The SNOboard has not yet made a final decision on the Operational Mode
document; some details of the SNO specific procedure need to be
defined.  However they have decided to send only POSSIBLE and never
GOOD alarms (or OVERRIDE, after human check), and so will only be able
to participate in a GOLD alarm as a "bystander".

* Super-K (M. Vagins): SK has implemented regular LED supernova tests
to test DAQ, and also shiftworker response.  Furthermore there have
been recent online supernova search improvements.  Alarms to SNEWS,
which are automated, have a rate much less than 1/week.

* KamLAND (G. Gratta): the KamLAND supernova trigger is a hardware
trigger, and is getting close to having a rate low enough (1/2-3
weeks) to be good enough for input to SNEWS.

* AMANDA: (A. Bouchta and A. Hallgren) they are working on noise
reduction in the supernova trigger.  Iridium communication available soon.

* Borexino:  supernova specific electronics is ready to go when
Borexino is ready.

* Report from Mini-BooNE, by email from Morgan Wascko:

"We have a supernova event trigger built into the DAQ that requires 60 or
more main tank PMT hits and fewer than 6 veto PMT hits.  We record these
events at ~11Hz, and write all of them to tape.  We currently do not
have an online cluster algorithm looking for peaks in the supernova
event rate, or any online event reconstruction.  However, we have
analyzed the supernova event stream for excesses around interesting
events, like GRB 030329.  (Btw, we have not seen any excesses yet.)

We also have a newly installed separate scaler system that reads out the
instantaneous tank and veto levels used by our trigger, and records five
second averages of these.  This system should provide a nice complement
to the supernova data stream and could be used to help beat down
backgrounds due to environmental fluctuations.  We'll see."

Discussion:
----------

 -- As usual, how specifically to balance fear of false alert vs
sensitivity is at issue: Should rates be dialed up as close to the
1/week limit as possible?  Should the coincidence time window be
reduced from 10 seconds?   Could we make a more complex coincidence
requirement, for instance look at duration of signal?  Is the high
rate suppression too stringent?  e.g. strange looking supernova
signals be demoted?

 -- Next face-to-face meeting: at TAUP, or perhaps LNGS or Duke.
