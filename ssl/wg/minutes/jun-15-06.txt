============================================================

-- I gave a brief update: slides at
https://snews.bnl.gov/wg/minutes/snews_nu2006.pdf
 We are in a smoothly running mode with 4 experiments: SK, SNO, LVD,
and AMANDA/IceCube.  All experiments now have automated input.  The
latest operational mode incorporates "individual" alert mode, which is
allows an individual experiment to forward a confirmed (human-checked)
alarm via the SNEWS infrastructure.  To do: expansion of the
astronomer network.

-- Mark Vagins suggested that the alert mailing list subscriber list be
visible to subscribers.  This can easily be configured. 

-- Takeda-san reported on SK status: slides at
https://snews.bnl.gov/wg/minutes/takeda_nu2006.pdf
SK full reconstruction took place over last winter and filling is
nearly finished; SK-III normal running will start in mid-July.

-- Clarence Virtue reported on SNO status: slides at 
https://snews.bnl.gov/wg/minutes/virtue_nu2006.ppt
SNO input to SNEWS is now automated. Clarence described the burst
response team and detailed procedure.  SNO will run until the end of
2006.

-- Carlo Vigorito reported from LVD: slides at
https://snews.bnl.gov/wg/minutes/vigorito_nu2006.ppt LVD has been
running very stably, with 99.98% uptime in their recent run.  They
will soon be functioning as a CNGS beam monitor.

-- Kazumi Ishii reported from KamLAND: KamLAND will soon be ready for
SNEWS input. She presented a poster on the KamLAND SN trigger at the
conference.

-- Rex Tayloe reported from mini-BooNE: slides at
https://snews.bnl.gov/wg/minutes/tayloe_nu2006.pdf Mini-BooNE has an
SN trigger in place which will allow SN-like events to be written and
stored, although currently rate is too high for input to SNEWS.

-- AMANDA/IceCube reps sent their regrets; no SN people attended
Nu2006, although they have been providing alarms to SNEWS for nearly a
year now. Here is some info (from Lutz Koepke): typical time delay
for an alarm is 200-600 secs, and they now have 24 hour coverage
using Iridium.
