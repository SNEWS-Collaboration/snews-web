Minutes, SNEWS meeting at Neutrino 2010
===========================

Attendees: Gianmarco Bruno, Frank Calaprice, Mark Chen, Patrick Decowski, Alec
Habig, Andrea Molinario, Masayuki Nakahata, Kate Scholberg, Mike
Schumaker, Yoichiro Suzuki, Clarence Virtue, Morgan Wascko

-- I gave the overall SNEWS update: slides posted.  Highlights:
       * Everything running smoothly, currently with SK+LVD+IceCube+Borexino.
       * The BNL MOU was refreshed in 2009.
       * We have a new 3-year NSF grant.
       * A recent flurry of SNEWS alert mailing list signups was precipitated by an
internet rumor that Betelgeuse is about to blow!
       * We have a new enabled direct connection to the eStar robotic telescope
network.
 
-- Masayuki Nakahata gave the Super-K update: SK has been running as
   SK-IV, with new electronics and software trigger, since September
   2008.  The SK-IV SNwatch software has been updated (it's now
   located outside the mine) and the SNEWS alert was implemented within a
   few months of the start of SK-IV.  There have been improvements to
   minimize deadtime-- little supernova data will be lost during
   calibration.

-- Patrick Decowski reported on KamLAND: after purification, trigger
rates are reduced.  An online reconstruction for a SN trigger may be
possible.  He also mentioned ANTARES: they may be able to use SNEWS
output in a way similar to what they do now for GRB triggers, to
improve sensitivity.

-- Frank Calaprice reported for Alvaro Chavarria on Borexino.  Update
   info from Alvaro, by email:

       * Borexino officially started sending alarms to SNEWS on July 13, 2009.
       * They have implemented an internal notification and subsequent
         alarm suppression system for Borexino alarms (should have
         negligible dead time).
       * Uptime is limited by radioactive source calibrations but
         >90%; they are aiming for >99%.

-- Andrea Molinario reported for LVD.  They have full efficiency for
supernova neutrino burst detection up to 30 kpc, continuous monitoring
for 18 years with very high duty cycle, and very close to 1 kton
trigger mass for the past several years.  They have a new Galactic
supernova rate limit.  A DAQ upgrade will be completed in July-- this
will not affect SNEWS connectivity.

-- Clarence Virtue reported on HALO: construction is proceeding well
   and they expect to have a SN trigger in 2011.

-- SNO+ is also progressing well.

-- Reina Maruyama (who could not attend) sent some update slides for
   IceCube.  79 strings are in operation and all 86 strings will be
   completed in 2011 (AMANDA is now decommissioned).  Detector performance
   is well understood, and the supernova system recently underwent an
   internal review.  Distance reach is well beyond the Galaxy, and
   physics studies indicate sensitivity to various interesting
   physics.
