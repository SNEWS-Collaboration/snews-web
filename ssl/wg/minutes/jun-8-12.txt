Minutes, SNEWS meeting at Neutrino 2012
=======================================

Attendees: Frank Calaprice, Walter Fulgione, Alec Habig, Francis Halzen, Kunio Inoue,
Kam-Biu Luk, Reina Maruyama, Christian Ott, Hamish Robertson, Kate Scholberg, Yoichiro
Suzuki, Andrzej Szelc, Mark Vagins, Carlo Vigorito, Clarence Virtue

-- I gave the overall SNEWS update: slides posted.  Everything running
smoothly, currently with SK+LVD+IceCube+Borexino (no change in the
operational mode since 2009).  The BNL server has been updated to a
virtualized setup for easier failover. A backup server exists at
Bologna for the case of BNL network downtime; we switch over to this a
few times per year.  There has been is essentially no SNEWS server
downtime in the past few years.

-- Alec Habig reported that NOvA will have a supernova trigger when it
   starts running.

-- Andrej Szelc reported for MicroBooNE: they expect to be running in
   about two years.  They will run in a mode that keeps a large buffer
   of data to be kept for the case of supernova trigger.

-- Carlo Vigorito reported for LVD.  They have now been online for 20 years.  For the past several years there has been very high uptime with ~1kt active mass. There has been recent work to
improve hardware for timing for neutrino TOF measurement.  Slides are posted.

-- Mark Vagins gave the Super-K update: uptime when the T2K beam is
   not on has about 96%, and more than that when the T2K beam is on.
   A new online SN system will be installed this summer which will
   enable <1 min delay.

-- Clarence Virtue reported for both SNO+ and HALO.  SNO+ should be
   running at the end of 2013.  HALO is now running, with 79 tons of
   lead and 128 of the SNO NCDs.  HV is on all channels and full detector is being
   read out since May 8, 2012.  Participation in SNEWS is expected by the end of
   the year.   Slides are posted.

-- Kam-Biu Luk reported that Shaomin Chen will be working on supernova
   sensitivity for Daya Bay.  They have 160 tons of scintillator at 3
   sites.

-- Reina Maruyama reported for IceCube.  IceCube is now complete with
   a stable geometry, and two redundant data flows from the Pole
   enable more reliable alert output.  They have made recent
   improvements to the supernova trigger, fixing delays and remedying
   duplicate alarm issues.

-- Frank Calaprice reported for Borexino.  Borexino has 95% uptime.
   Laura Cadonati is a candidate to take over supernova work from
   Alvaro Chavarria.  Future purification campaigns are planned.

-- Christian Ott gave a brief gravitational wave update.  The first generation
  network (LIGO-GEO-Virgo-TAMA) ran from 2000-2010.  Next generation
   detectors are in the works: Advanced LIGO and VIRGO, KAGRA.  Next data will
   be in 2015/16.   These will be able to detect core collapses even for pessimistic models.  A new
   development is a plan to move one of the LIGO interferometers to
   India.  He pointed out that a joint neutrino-GW search will enable
   improvement of sensitivity for both.  Slides are posted.

-- Mark Vagins reported on the AstroAlert message: this is a
Unfortunately the time window for possible collapse time is rather
small.  If it had been a standard core-collapse it would have been
seen by SK and probably other detectors, if any were on-- however
possibly some were off.  SK is searching through test and calibration
runs.  This is a possible candidate for a joint offline search.
