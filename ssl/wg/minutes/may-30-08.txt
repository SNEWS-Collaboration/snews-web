Subject: [Snews-wg] SNEWS meeting minutes, Neutrino 2008

Hello all,

Thanks all who came to the meeting, and to the Nu2008 organizers for
helping with the venue.

Those who are not getting this email via one of the mailing lists can sign
up for them at  http://snews.bnl.gov/mailinglists.html

There are two lists:

- The snnet mailing is for casual observers (quite low traffic).

- The working group mailing list is for those interested in
participating in the working group (which has phone meetings every few
weeks).  Please email me for the password if you want to join this
list.

  My short SNEWS update talk will be posted on the working group page.

Main points:
  - Everything has been running very stably at the BNL server; uptime
is essentially 100%.
  - SNEWS had SK/SNO/AMANDA/LVD until the end of 2006, after which SNO
finished, and we moved back to 2/3 coincidence mode.
  - We added a backup server at the U. of Bologna in fall of 2006.  This
receives alarms from experiments in parallel to the BNL machine, but
alert output is only enabled if there's an outage at BNL.  So far this only
happened a few times.
  - We've initiated some collaboration with robotic telescope networks,
e.g. eSTAR.

There was some discussion about revisiting the idea of triangulation
to determine signal direction.  Triangulation so far has been pretty
much out of reach due to insufficient statistics.  However, now
IceCube is online, which may have a large enough single-photon signal
to measure the timing very precisely.  It will be important to find a
consistent way to share timing information. Francis suggested that
IceCube may be able to provide a template for other experiments to fit
signal to.


Experiment updates:

  - Mark Vagins reported for Super-K.  SK has been running with
  excellent supernova sensitivity and prompt alert input to SNEWS for
  many years.  Electronics will be upgraded at the end of this summer:
  the upgrade to "SK IV' will take about two months, during with SK
  will be pretty much off.  The electronics replacement will be
  followed by an extensive recalibration campaign, which will also
  reduce supernova livetime.

[Note that long planned downtime periods are posted on the SNEWS
working group downtime page-- experiments can consult this page to
arrange planned downtime to *not* coincide with other experiment
downtime, so that global supernova sensitivity is optimized].

  - Walter Fulgione reported on LVD status.  LVD has been operational
  for more than 15 years, and reached full configuration at ~1 kt in
  2000.  Duty cycle is near 100%.  Background fluctuations are well
  studied, and they use a threshold for SNEWS which gives ~1
  alarm/month [note correction from emailed minutes].  Sensitivity is
  to the entire galaxy. (See ref: N. Yu Agafonova et al,
  Astropart. Phys.  28/6 pp516-522.)

  - Clarence Virtue gave a short presentation on future experiments at 
SNOlab: SNO+ and HALO.

SNO+ is a 1 kt scintillator experiment which should see a few hundred
events at 10 kpc. SNO+ can make use of a good deal of the hardware and
software infrastructure and experience developed for the SNO supernova
trigger, although various modifications are needed.

HALO is a lead-based detector dedicated to supernova detection, which
will use the SNO NCD counters.  76 tons of lead are available, which
will yield several dozen events for a Galactic supernova.  Engineering
work is underway.  Mark and Frank suggested some potential sources of
additional lead.

  - Alvaro Chavarria reported on Borexino status: there has been a lot
  supernova monitor progress lately.  They expect about 250 events
  total above their very low energy threshold of 200 eV, at 10 kpc.
  Borexino's PSD gives good sensitivity to elastic scattering on
  protons.  There are some backgrounds, including electronic noise, but
  they expect to reduce this to a level that will give an alarm rate
  suitable for SNEWS.  There are three independent DAQs that will be
  combined for a SNEWS alarm.  The first implementation of Borexino's
  supernova alarm should be able to trigger for a supernova 30 kpc away;
  this should improve to 60 kpc once the main electronics supernova
  trigger comes online.  Borexino plans to join SNEWS before Sept 2008.

  - Chuck Lane reported on KamLAND status.  Fiducial mass is 1 kt and
  threshold is less than 1 MeV. A supernova trigger exists, and has
  been running for several years.  Technical setup for SNEWS is not too far
  from being ready.  The collaboration is busy with purification work
  at the moment, but hopes to join SNEWS at some point.

  - Francis Halzen reported on AMANDA/IceCube status.  A performance
  paper is in the works: IceCube will have a huge statistics signal of
  single counts. The current supernova trigger is based on AMANDA, and
  the addition of IceCube strings to SNEWS will happen soon.  Alarm
  rate is still a bit high, but they are continuing to work on it.
  Communications uptime is now ~100%.

  - Francesco Arneodo reported that they hope to have Icarus online soon and
   to have everything running within a year.

  - Heather Ray reported on MiniBooNE: because it's on the surface,
  MiniBooNE will be too noisy to be an input to SNEWS, but it will have
  a signal and can do offline analysis promptly in the case of a SNEWS
  alert.
