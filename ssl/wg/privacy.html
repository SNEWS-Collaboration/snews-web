<H2> Supernova Working Group Agreement and Privacy Rules</H2>

<UL>
<li>  <h3>Working group</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The "working group" will consist of one or many members per
experiment, regardless of whether the experiment is providing alarms
to the coincidence server. (Collaborators on proposed experiments are
welcome, too).

<li> Working group members will have access to coincidence code working
and test areas on shared machines (e.g. kaboom), but not the complete
experimental alarm input information of the real running version(s).

<li> Working group members can contribute to the coincidence code (via
cvs or whatever code-sharing method we decide to use).

<li> They agree to keep this code private by taking reasonable security
precautions e.g. have protections on their working areas on their home
machines.  (Widespread code dissemination could be a security risk for
fraud).   

<li> Working group members should also be willing to make
use of <A href=security_tools.txt> standard security tools</A> when
connecting to the coincidence server machines.

<li> The working group members will participate in technical decisions,
and also agree to act as liasons to their experimental collaborations.

</UL>
<p>
<li>  <h3>Subgroup</h3>
<p>
<ul>

<li> The "subgroup" will consist of at least one member per experiment
which is actively providing alarms to the coincidence server machines
(but the number of subgroup members should be kept as small as
possible).

<li> Subgroup members will have access to the complete alarm
information of all experiments providing input to the coincidence
server.  They agree to keep all individual experiment information
(alarm rate, alarm times, alive/dead status, etc.) private, at both a
formal and informal level (i.e. no publishing, no gossiping!)

<li> Subgroup members will authorize releases of the software, and maintain
the actual running versions of the software.

</ul>
<p>
<li> <h3> Alarm mailing list</h3>
<p>
A mailing list of people who wish to be alerted in the case of the
automated inter-experiment coincidence will be maintained.  There will
be no restrictions on the members of this list; anyone interested
(astronomers, neutrino experimenters, New York Times reporters) can be
on it.
</ul>

<p>The names of the members of all 3 groups will be public.
